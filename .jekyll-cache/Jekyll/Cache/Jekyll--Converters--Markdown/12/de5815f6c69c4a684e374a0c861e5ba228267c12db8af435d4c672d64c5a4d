I"p<p>When Boxfuse deploys your apps to AWS, a two-step process takes places. First, Boxfuse creates 
Amazon Machine Images, simply known as AMIs. Using these, EC2 instances can then be launched.</p>

<p>AMI creation has traditionally been rather time consuming. So much so that many AWS deployment technologies
chose to forgo custom AMIs and all their benefits, and instead go for the more brittle process of launching an instance
from a standard AMI and customizing it on startup.</p>

<p>Not so with Boxfuse. Not only does Boxfuse fully embrace immutable infrastructure and the
<a href="/blog/no-ssh">benefits of no SSH</a>, but today, building upon last month’s release of <a href="/blog/private-vault">Private Vault</a>
we are unveiling a new fast and secure AMI provisioning mechanism which works across all supported AWS regions called
<strong>Boxfuse FastAMI</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-boxfuse-fastami">Introducing Boxfuse FastAMI</h2>

<p>Today we are introducing <strong>Boxfuse FastAMI</strong>: a transparent, fast and secure way to rapidly provision AMIs fully within your
AWS account.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/fastami/fastami.png" alt="FastAMI" /></p>

<p>It works as follows: when Boxfuse needs to create a new AMI it first launches a t2.micro instance in the default VPC of
that region of your account. This instance then securily listens to AMI conversion requests. Once it receives such a
request it pulls an image from your encrypted S3 private vault bucket and turns it into an encrypted AMI, all without
the image data ever leaving your AWS account. This instance stays active until it hasn’t seen a new request for 60
minutes, at which point it terminates automatically.</p>

<p>This incurs a small cost of about 0.01 USD for AWS accounts that are no longer eligible for the AWS free tier. We felt
this was a reasonable trade-off for all the the privacy, security and speed advantages of Boxfuse FastAMI.</p>

<h2 id="available-today">Available today</h2>

<p>Boxfuse FastAMI is available today at no additional charge to all Boxfuse users who have already migrated their account to
<a href="/blog/private-vault">Private Vault</a>. Support for this is fully transparent and initially
available in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-east-1</code>and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-west-2</code> regions. The remaining AWS regions will be enabled in the coming weeks.
Simply deploy images stored in your Private Vault to environments in any of those regions and you’ll
automatically benefit from the privacy, security and speed advantages of Boxfuse FastAMI. Enjoy!</p>
