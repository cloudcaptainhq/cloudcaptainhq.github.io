<h2 id="spring-boot-2-support">Spring Boot 2 support</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/springboot.png" alt="Spring Boot" /></p>

<p>Building upon Boxfuse’s existing [Spring Boot 1.x support] (/blog/spring-boot-ec2), Boxfuse now fully supports 
<strong>Spring Boot 2.0</strong> and newer apps.</p>

<p>Spring Boot 2.0 is autodetected and Boxfuse will then auto-configure ports, healthchecks and more based on the new
property names introduced in Spring Boot’s 2.0 release.</p>

<h2 id="t3-and-r5-instance-support">T3 and R5 instance support</h2>

<p>AWS recently released their new all hardware hypervisor called the <strong>Nitro System</strong> and along with it a number of
<a href="/blog/nitro">new instance types</a> making full use of it.</p>

<p>Today Boxfuse expands its instance support to two new instances families, both running on the Nitro System.</p>

<p>First of all, Boxfuse now supports the brand new t3 burstable instances. They are 10% more cost effective than t2 and
run on more powerful hardware. All t2 users are encouraged to make the switch.</p>

<p>In addition to that, for RAM-heavy apps Boxfuse now fully supports the new r5 instances. The are more cost effective,
support more memory and come in a larger sizes at the top end as previous r4 and r3 instances. All r4 and r3 users are
encouraged to make the switch.</p>
