I"—<p>When it comes to running production apps, Boxfuse offers a range of options, from single-instance to load-balanced and
<a href="/blog/worker">worker</a> apps. They cover a wide range of scenarios from simple hobby apps to complex and robust
robust auto-scaling auto-recovering production workloads.</p>

<p>But sometimes all you need is a single run of an administrative or maintenance task.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-one-off-apps">Introducing one-off apps</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/one-off/one-off.png" alt="one-off app" /></p>

<p>Today we are introducing a new type of app: <strong>one-off</strong></p>

<p>This is an app that starts, does its thing and once it is done, the application process can safely exit and the instance
will terminate. This is particularly useful for administrative or maintenance workloads where you just want a single
task to complete and thatâ€™s it.</p>

<p>Typical uses would be one-time data exports/imports, data transformation, batch operations or ad-hoc system maintenance.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Say you have a maintenance job packaged as a jar file. You can simply run it on your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prod</code> environment as follows:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run my-maintenance-job-1.0.jar <strong>-app.type=one-off</strong> -env=prod</pre>

<p>This will launch an AWS instance in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prod</code> with environment with your job running. Once the main method terminates
or the application exits with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.exit()</code> the instance will automatically shut down and AWS will stop charging you
for it.</p>

<h2 id="available-today">Available today</h2>

<p>Support for <strong>one-off</strong> apps is available today at no additional charge on all paid Boxfuse plans. Enjoy!</p>
