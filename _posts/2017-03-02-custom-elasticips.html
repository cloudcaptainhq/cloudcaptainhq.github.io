<p>When you need your application to have a unique public IP address that doesn't change over time, Boxfuse lets you
    create your application as <code>single-instance</code> to ensure it will always be deployed behind the same
    <strong>AWS Elastic IP</strong> at runtime.</p>

<p>Until now, Boxfuse has always automatically provisioned that Elastic IP address (along with all other AWS resources) for you.
This is extremely convenient and by far the best choice for the vast majority of the <code>single-instance</code> applications.</p>

<p>There are however a number of cases where this falls short. The most common one is being able to know the exact IP address
in advance to ensure the necessary firewall or security group rules have been set up correctly. This is especially relevant when
 an application doesn't need to be up 24/7. So far killing an application meant terminating all related AWS resources,
    including the Elastic IP. When running it again the application would get the same <code>boxfuse.io</code>
    or <a href="/blog/custom-domains">custom domain</a>, however a new Elastic IP would be created and the DNS A record
    would then point at that one instead.</p>

<p>Today we are introducing support for <strong>custom Elastic IPs</strong> for <code>single-instance</code> apps to fix this.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>First of all, ensure you have allocated the Elastic IP you need either via the AWS Console or some other client.</p>

<p>From here on things couldn't be easier. Simply go to your application in the <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse Console</a>
and configure it for the environment you want:</p>

<p>And now simply select the Elastic IP of your choice from the list and your app will be deployed  behind it.</p>

<p>Needless to say, once deployed the <code>boxfuse.io</code> or <a href="/blog/custom-domains">custom domain</a> will also point directly at that Elastic IP.</p>

<h2>Using the Boxfuse Client</h2>

<p>If you prefer to use the Boxfuse Client instead, you can simply specify the Elastic IP as follows:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod <strong>-elasticip=</strong>35.157.139.99</pre>

<p>And for <strong>infrastructure as code</strong> simply place it in your <code>boxfuse.conf</code> file
    which you can check in to version control along with your sources:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">elasticip=35.157.139.99</pre>
