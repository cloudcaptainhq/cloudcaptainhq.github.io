<p>Application and server monitoring provide invaluable insights into the health and availability of your apps. Today
we are introducing <strong>first-class support for <strong><a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a></strong></strong>
    with automatic installation and configuration of both the New Relic Servers Linux x64 agent and the New Relic Java agent.</p>

<h2>Server Monitoring</h2>
<p>New Relic's free server monitoring provides you with in-depth monitoring of CPU usage, load average,
    physical memory, disk I/O, network I/O and processes.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To enable this for your app, simply pass in your New Relic license key when fusing an image:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse fuse <strong>-newrelic.licensekey=</strong>0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567</pre>

<p>Boxfuse will then automatically install the <strong>New Relic Servers Linux x64 agent</strong> and configure it to start reporting to your New Relic account.</p>

<h2>Application Monitoring (JVM apps only)</h2>

<p>To provide you even deeper insights, New Relic also comes with monitoring at the application level with detailed analysis
    of transactions, throughput, database queries and much more. Additionally you can also define alerts to get notified
of performance degradations and availability issues with your app.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>For JVM apps, when supplying your New Relic license key as described above, Boxfuse will also automatically
    install and configure the <strong>New Relic Java agent</strong>.</p>

<p>The application will then begin reporting to New Relic as <code>myapp (myenv)</code>.
    In case of an application named <code>hello</code> deployed in the <code>prod</code> <a href="/docs/environments">environment</a>
    this would then be <code>hello (prod)</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can also supply a <code>newrelic.yml</code> configuration file for the Java agent and Boxfuse will
    automatically use that instead. Boxfuse will then install the agent for you, but won't override any application name you may have configured.
    If you haven't configured a New Relic license key as described above, Boxfuse will use
    the license key contained in your <code>newrelic.yml</code> configuration file instead.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Boxfuse now has <strong>first-class support for New Relic</strong>. This provides you with a robust and in-depth monitoring
service for both your instances and the apps running on them.</p>

<p>All you need to do is literally pass your New Relic license key when fusing an image and the necessary New Relic Servers Linux x64
and New Relic Java agents will be automatically installed and configured for you.</p>

<p>This new feature is available at no charge to all Boxfuse users.</p>
