<p>This month Boxfuse turned 2 and it's come a long way since <a href="/blog/welcome">its humble beginnings</a>! In
fact only since <a href="/blog/one-year">last year's anniversary</a> we have added a lot of major new features including
<a href="/blog/oracle-jre">custom JREs</a>, <a href="/blog/oracle-jre">kernel tuning</a>, <a href="/blog/live-reloading">live reloading</a>,
    <a href="/blog/worker">worker apps</a>, <a href="/blog/go-aws">Go and Revel support</a>, <a href="/blog/newrelic">New Relic integration</a>,
    <a href="/blog/cloudwatch-logs">CloudWatch Logs integration</a>, <a href="/blog/linux-x64">generic Linux x64 apps</a>,
    <a href="/blog/custom-domains">custom domains</a> and <a href="/blog/custom-elasticips">custom Elastic IPs</a>.
    And that's of course on top of the countless minor features and polish which have been integrated in the
    <a href="/docs/releasenotes">62 Boxfuse Client updates</a> released in the past year alone!</p>

<p>Today we are kicking of Boxfuse's third year with a very highly requested new feature: <strong>automatic TLS (SSL) certificate
    management</strong> and renewal.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Load balanced apps using a <a href="/blog/custom-domains">custom domains</a> can now be configured to automatically
expose themselves via HTTPS with a TLS (SSL) certificate issued by the AWS Certificate Manager.</p>

<p>Boxfuse configures the ELB to terminate the client-facing TLS connection with a valid TLS certificate and
    forward the request to your backend instances using TLS connection with a self-signed certificate.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" width="300" src="/assets/posts/tls-ssl-certificates/http-green-lock.png"></p>

<p>Once set up, the <strong>certificates auto-renew</strong> before they expire without any action required on your behalf.
    This ensures clients always see a green lock in the browser while at the same time always ensuring all data in motion
    travels encrypted.</p>

<h2>Seeing it in action</h2>

<p>Let's see what this looks like in action. For this post, we're going to deploy a Spring Boot application with HTTPS at
<code>boot.boxfuse-example.com</code>, which will be a new subdomain of the <code>boxfuse-example.com</code> domain which we own.</p>

<h2>Obtaining our certificate</h2>

<p>First, let's get the certificate part out of the way. To do so we're going to the
    <a href="https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=eu-central-1#/">AWS Certificate Manager</a> page
    of the AWS Console and we request a wildcard certificate for our domain:</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/posts/tls-ssl-certificates/acm-request.png"></p>

<p>Once we have received the email from AWS requesting us to confirm our ownership of the domain for the certificate,
    we click on the approval link:</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/posts/tls-ssl-certificates/acm-email.png"></p>

<p>Our wildcard certificate is now ready to use.</p>

<h2>Creating the app</h2>

<p>We now need a basic Spring Boot app to deploy. For this we're going to generate one with the
    <a href="http://start.spring.io">Spring Initializr</a> and add a basic controller. To do this, we simply follow the
    steps described in our <a href="/getstarted/springboot">Spring Boot getting started guide</a>.</p>

<p>Once that is done, we go ahead and build it:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> mvnw package</pre>

<h2>Running our application</h2>
<p>All we need to do now is run our application on AWS using our new subdomain (which will be auto-created) and
    our freshly created wildcard certificate. To do so we make sure the <code>app.type</code>, <code>tls.type</code>
    and <code>domain</code> parameters are set correctly:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run <strong>-app.type=load-balanced -tls.type=acm -domain=boot.boxfuse-example.com</strong> -env=prod

<p>And here is our app up and running with a valid TLS (SSL) certificate and a green lock in the browser:</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/posts/tls-ssl-certificates/browser.png"></p>

<p>And that's it! Boxfuse automatically created and configured the AMI, the security groups, the Elastic Load Balancer,
    the CloudWatch Logs stream, the Auto-Scaling group and the instances and everything is fully set up and secure.
    And best of all, our <strong>TLS (SSL) certificate will be automatically renewed</strong> and updated before it expires without any
    action required on our behalf.</p>
