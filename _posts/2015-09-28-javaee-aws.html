    <p>At <a href="https://boxfuse.com">Boxfuse</a> we love solutions that just work. And that's why, when it comes to
        Java EE, we've grown very fond of <strong><a href="http://tomee.apache.org">Apache TomEE</a></strong>. Unlike traditional heavy
        and complex application servers, TomEE combines the swiftness of Tomcat with the benefits of standard Java EE.</p>

    <p>Today we are happy to announce that we have added TomEE to Boxfuse's selection of payloads that can be deployed
        effortlessly to VirtualBox and AWS. Just like <a href="/docs/payloads/dropwizard">Dropwizard</a>,
        <a href="/docs/payloads/springboot">Spring Boot</a>, <a href="/docs/payloads/tomcat">Tomcat</a> and
        <a href="/docs/payloads/jar">(executable) jar files</a>, you can now fuse <a href="/docs/payloads/tomee">TomEE applications</a> into
        immutable images with a single command. These images can then be deployed unchanged to VirtualBox and AWS
        with zero downtime updates.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Why TomEE?</h2>
    <p>At its core <strong><a href="http://tomee.apache.org">Apache TomEE</a></strong> stands for 3 things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be small</li>
        <li>Be Java EE certified</li>
        <li>Be Tomcat</li>
    </ul>

    <p>TomEE does away with long and tedious deployments typically associated with Java EE. Instead you now get a Tomcat
        that has been tuned to be able to run Java EE applications. It's still Tomcat, but it is now also fully Java EE
        certified with support for EJB, CDI, JMS and more. It starts quickly and does away with .ear files. Instead you
        can simply use tried and true .war files and define any JNDI resources in <code>WEB-INF/resources.xml</code>.
        Java EE has never been this simple!</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>Before we get started ensure you have <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">created a Boxfuse account</a> (it's free, just log in with your GitHub id).
        Make sure to associate it with your <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a> in the <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse console</a> to deploy on EC2.</p>
    <p>You will also need Git, Java, Maven and VirtualBox installed on your machine.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Creating a TomEE Java EE app</h2>
    <p>Start by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/boxfuse/boxfuse-samples">Boxfuse Samples</a> repository:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; git clone https://github.com/boxfuse/boxfuse-samples.git</pre>

    <p>and build the TomEE sample application:</p>
    <pre class="console">&gt; cd tomee
tomee&gt; mvn package</pre>

    <p>Great. You should now have a file called <code>target/tomee-1.0.war</code> as part of the following application:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/javaee-aws/intellij-tomee.png" alt="TomEE project structure">
    </div>

    <p>This application uses various Java EE features including EJBs, JSPs, Servlets, JPA and JNDI.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Deploying it to AWS EC2</h2>

    <p>Now that you have built the application, let's deploy it to AWS. Boxfuse will start by <a href="/learn/how">analysing it</a>
    and determining its type. Doing so it will find the <code>WEB-INF/resources.xml</code> file. This tells it that it is a Java EE that requires TomEE instead of Tomcat.</p>

    <p>Boxfuse will then <strong>create a Micro-OS on-the-fly</strong> designed to do one thing and one thing only: run this version of your application.</p>

    <p>It does that by combining your application with TomEE, a JVM, the C library, the Linux kernel and a bootloader into an tiny image.
    <strong>Everything is fully configured and ready to run out of the box</strong>:</p>

        <img src="/assets/posts/javaee-aws/tomee-aws-instance.png" alt="TomEE War file -> Boxfuse Image -> AWS Instance">
    </div>

    <p>To launch your application on AWS as well as <strong>provision and configure all necessary infrastructure</strong>, all you need to do is:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse run target/tomee-1.0.war -env=prod

    <p>And there you have it, your Java EE application is now fully up and running on AWS:</p>

    <p>You can deploy new versions at any time and Boxfuse will automatically perform <strong>blue/green zero downtime updates</strong> for you.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Summary</h2>

    <p>In this post you saw how <strong><a href="http://tomee.apache.org">Apache TomEE</a></strong> makes Java EE fast and lightweight.
    We took this to the next level by using <strong><a href="https://boxfuse.com">Boxfuse</a></strong> to deploy a Java EE application
        to AWS using a single command. There was no tedious configuration and the entire process took less than two minutes,
        including automatically provisioning all the necessary infrastructure on EC2.</p>

    <p><strong>Running your Java EE applications on AWS has never been this easy</strong>.</p>
