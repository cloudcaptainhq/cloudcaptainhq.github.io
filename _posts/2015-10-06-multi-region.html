    <p>At <a href="https://boxfuse.com">Boxfuse</a> we are strong believers in <strong><a href="/learn/why">Immutable Infrastructure</a></strong>.
        You generate an image once and you then deploy it across environments. All instances are based on the exact same set of bits and bytes.
        There is <strong><a href="/blog/no-ssh">no SSH</a></strong> to avoid drift and to ensure perfect <strong>environment parity</strong>
        from dev to prod.</p>

    <p>By default every new account comes with three environments:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <td><i class="fa fa-object-group"></i> <strong>dev</strong></td>
            <td>Develop with fast turnarounds on your local machine using VirtualBox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i class="fa fa-object-group"></i> <strong>test</strong></td>
            <td>Test your applications on AWS in a production-like environment</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i class="fa fa-object-group"></i> <strong>prod</strong></td>
            <td>Run your applications in production on AWS</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Introducing Custom Environments</h2>

    <p>While <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code> are sufficient for most projects, a number of you have come to us and asked for the ability to define additional environments like <code>staging</code>
        for example. Today we are please to announce that this is now the case. All users on <a href="/pricing">paid plans</a>
    can start creating <strong>custom environments</strong> in the Boxfuse Console with a few clicks:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/multi-region/create.png" alt="Create Environment">
    </div>

    <p>The <a href="/docs/commandline">Boxfuse Client</a> works with them as expected, simply specify the new environment and you're good to go:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse run myapp -env=staging</pre>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Introducing Multi-Region Apps</h2>

    <p>While custom environments are great, we decided to take things further. You can now create custom environments in AWS regions
    that differ from your default Boxfuse AWS region by simply selecting the target region while creating the custom environment:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/img/env-new.png" alt="Multi-Region Apps">
    </div>
    <p>This effectively lets you easily create <strong>multi-region apps</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code> are sufficient for most projects, Boxfuse now has
        you covered when you grow beyond that. All users on <a href="/pricing">paid plans</a> can now define
        <strong>custom environments</strong> and start creating <strong>multi-region apps</strong> with ease and pleasure.</p>
