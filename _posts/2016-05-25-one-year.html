subtitle: "One Year of Boxfuse"

<p>Last month marked one year since the <a href="/blog/welcome">initial version of Boxfuse was released</a>. We are now
    many many features and over 100 Boxfuse Client releases further. And what a
    ride it's been!</p>

<p>Boxfuse set out to make the deployment of applications to the cloud absolutely effortless by leveraging its three
    core principles:</p>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td><a href="/learn/why"><strong>
            <nobr>Immutable Infrastructure</nobr>
        </strong></a></td>
        <td>Creating servers and never modifying them again by treating a server as one immutable
            unit that is regenerated after every change and promoted unchanged from environment to environment.
            This eliminates drift and increases reliability by ensuring you run the exact same code in production as
            the code you tested in test.

        <td>Analysing your application and generating minimal tailor-made Linux-based images on the fly that
            are 100x smaller than a typical Linux system and take just seconds to produce.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3.</td>
        <td><strong>Blue/Green deployments</strong></td>
        <td>Deploying a new version of an app in parallel to the existing one and only making the switch at the elastic
            IP
            or elastic load balancer level once the configured health checks of the new version have passed. Deployments
            are fully
            automated and effectively transactional, providing you with zero-downtime updates.
        </td>
    </tr>

<h2>The humble beginnings</h2>
<p>We had to start out somewhere and so we picked one problem and decided to solve it better than anyone else out there:
    <a href="/blog/dropwizard-aws">deploying Dropwizard applications to AWS</a>:</p>

<div class="blog-post-image">
    <img style="height: 250px" src="/assets/posts/dropwizard-aws/dropwizard-aws.png">
</div>

<p>This provided us with a great testbed to both validate our innovative technology
    (<a href="/learn/how">generating minimal images on-the-fly in seconds</a>) as well as to
    pioneer our deep integration features (<a href="/docs/payloads/dropwizard">extracting port and healthcheck configuration directly
        out of Dropwizard's native configuration files</a>)</p>

<p>We launched with support for testing locally on VirtualBox and performing blue/green deployments atomically on AWS with zero downtime updates.
We introduced this both for single instance applications (using an Elastic IP) as well as load balanced applications (using an Elastic Load Balancer).</p>

<p>We have always been strong proponents of Continuous Deployments and making Boxfuse a natural fit for this was a no-brainer.
From day one we shipped both a cross-platform CLI (the <a href="/docs/commandline">Boxfuse Command-line Client</a>) as well
as a build tool plugin (the <a href="/docs/maven">Boxfuse Maven plugin</a>) to make it trivial to automate
your deployment workflows.</p>

<h2>Expanding to more JVM frameworks</h2>
<p>Building upon the foundation laid out with Dropwizard, Boxfuse successively added deep integration for most common modern JVM
application frameworks. Over the course of this first year, Boxfuse added support for
    <a href="/blog/springboot-ec2">Spring Boot</a>, <a href="/blog/playframework-aws">Play</a>,
    <a href="/blog/grails-aws">Grails</a>, <a href="/docs/payloads/jar">plain executable Jars</a>,
    <a href="/docs/payloads/tomcat">Tomcat</a> and even <a href="/blog/javaee-aws">TomEE</a> for JavaEE applications.</p>

<div style="padding-bottom: 15px">
    <img style="height: 60px; margin-right: 20px;" src="/assets/img/springboot.png">
    <img style="height: 60px; margin-right: 20px;" src="/assets/img/play.png">
    <img style="height: 60px; margin-right: 20px;" src="/assets/img/grails.png">
    <img style="height: 60px; margin-right: 20px;" src="/assets/img/tomcat.png">
    <img style="height: 60px; margin-right: 20px;" src="/assets/img/tomee.png">
</div>

<p>We also made sure it is easy for users of those frameworks to discover Boxfuse by contributing sections to the
official documentation of both Spring Boot and the Play framework.</p>

<p>And we introduced the <a href="/blog/gradle-plugin">Boxfuse Gradle Plugin</a> (available directly from
the <a href="/blog/gradle-plugin-portal">Gradle Plugin Portal</a>) to make the integration even nicer.</p>

<h2>Auto-scaling</h2>
<p>Auto-scaling is one of those true innovations of the cloud and it fits Boxfuse's immutable minimal images like a glove.
So it was only natural that we added first-class support to <a href="/blog/auto-scaling">dynamically scale the capacity of your system</a> based on either
CPU or network usage:</p>

<div class="blog-post-image"><img style="height: 300px" src="/assets/img/auto-scaling-console.png"></div>

<h2>Database auto-provisioning</h2>
<p>As many users rely on relational databases to store their data, Boxfuse stepped in to make sure it became
absolutely trivial to <a href="/blog/databases">provision PostgreSQL and MySQL databases</a> reliably across all <a href="/docs/environments">environments</a> from dev on VirtualBox
to test and prod on AWS.</p>

<div class="blog-post-image">
    <img style="height: 150px" src="/assets/img/rds.png">
</div>

<p>This also marked the introduction of the Boxfuse Dev VM on VirtualBox, providing you with fully
configured database instances ready to be used by your application, without the need to install those yourself on your machine.</p>

<p>Wherever your framework of choices supports it, Boxfuse also automatically configures it to automatically use
the correct database instance with the correct credentials in each environment.</p>

<p>And of course to easily and reliably evolve your database schema over time, our database migration tool
    <a href="https://flywaydb.org">Flyway</a> is there to help you too.</p>

<h2>Debugging and Profiling</h2>
<p>To make it easier to see what's going on with your application, Boxfuse introduced
first class support for <a href="/blog/debug">debugging and profiling</a>, both locally on VirtualBox
    and directly in the cloud for your instances running on AWS.</p>

<div class="blog-post-image">
    <img style="height: 200px;" src="/assets/img/jvisualvm.png">
</div>

<p>As many of those protocols are insecure, Boxfuse automatically makes use of its support
for <a href="/blog/restricted-ports">restricted ports</a> to ensure that by default those
interfaces are only accessible from your current IP.</p>

<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p>Based on widespread demand from our customers, we added support for our first
    language platform beyond the JVM with first class <a href="/blog/nodejs-aws">Node.js support</a>.</p>

<div class="blog-post-image">
    <img style="height: 150px;" src="/assets/posts/nodejs-aws/nodejs-aws.png">
</div>

<p>As the Node.js runtime is more compact this resulted in super fast fusing times with images as small as 15 MB!</p>

<h2>This is just the beginning</h2>

<p>To mark the beginning of our second year, we are kicking things off with a bang and have released
support for three new features:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Node.js LTS releases</strong>: you can now use all current Node.js releases with Boxfuse in addition to the latest one</li>
    <li><strong>Instance auto-recovery</strong>: all single instance applications now automatically recover to new hardware with no manual intervention required if the current underlying EC2 hardware becomes impaired</li>
    <li><strong>Subnets restrictions</strong>: load balanced applications can now restrict exactly which subnets they wish to use within a VPC</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>But remember, this is just the beginning. <strong>We are only getting started!</strong></p>
