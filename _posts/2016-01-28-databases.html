    <p>In 2015 Boxfuse made it dead easy to run &amp <a href="/blog/auto-scaling">auto-scale</a> JVM applications on
        AWS.
        We added special optimizations for
        <a href="/blog/dropwizard-aws">Dropwizard</a>,
        <a href="/blog/spring-boot-ec2">Spring Boot</a>,
        <a href="/blog/playframework-aws">Play</a> and
        <a href="/blog/grails-aws">Grails</a> in addition to the support for executable jars, Tomcat and
        <a href="/blog/javaee-aws">TomEE</a> (for Java EE).
    </p>

    <p>While this provides a great help for tackling the complexity of the compute tier, many of our users who build
        microservices that follow the <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html">database
            per service</a>
        pattern have been asking for built-in support for relational databases.</p>

    <p>Today we are introducing <strong>dead-easy PostgreSQL database management</strong> for all environments, both
        locally using a new dev VM and on AWS using RDS.</p>

    <h2>What's included?</h2>

    <p>So what exactly is included in this feature? <strong>Boxfuse is now able to provision
        PostgreSQL
        databases both locally and on AWS</strong>.</p>

    <p>On your local machine, Boxfuse will launch a new dev VM alongside with your application that contains
        a <strong>fully configured PostgreSQL database</strong>. Your applications instances will then automatically
        receive environment
        variables containing the URL, user and password required to connect to that database. And if your application is
        based
        on Spring Boot, Grails, Play or Dropwizard <strong>Boxfuse will automatically configure your framework to use
            that database for its default datasource</strong>.</p>

    <p>On AWS, Boxfuse will <strong>automatically provision either single- or multi-AZ RDS instances</strong> for your
        application. You can
        easily scale those to different instance types or with additional storage. Just like on your local machine,
        your applications instances will automatically receive environment
        variables containing the URL, user and password required to connect to that database. And again if your
        application is based
        on Spring Boot, Grails, Play or Dropwizard Boxfuse will automatically configure your framework to use that
        database for its default datasource.</p>

    <h2>Let's explore this</h2>
    <p>To give you a better impression of this new feature, we'll walk you through a simple example where we <strong>build
        a
        Spring Boot microservice</strong> that uses a <strong>geo-replicated highly available PostgreSQL
        database</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>Before we get started ensure you have <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">created a Boxfuse account</a> (it's
        free, just log in with your GitHub id).
        Also make sure to associate it with your <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a> in the <a
                href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse console</a> to be able to deploy on EC2.</p>
    <p>You will also need a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK</a>
        and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> installed on your machine.</p>

    <h2>Step 0: Creating the Spring Boot microservice</h2>

    <p>Let's first create a basic Spring Boot application. Go to <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a>, select the
        PostgreSQL, JDBC and Web dependencies and click Generate Project:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/posts/databases/spring-initializr.png" alt="Spring Initializr"
             title="Spring Initializr">
    </div>

    <p>Now unpack your project in a new directory and delete the <code>src/test</code> (we won't need it in this
        tutorial). You should have the following structure:</p>

    <pre class="filetree"><i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> database-demo
  <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> src
    <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> main
      <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> java
        <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> boxfusedemo
          <i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> DatabaseDemoApplication.java
      <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> resources
        <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> static
        <i class="fa fa-folder"></i> templates
        <i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> application.properties
    <i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> mvnw
    <i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> mvnw.cmd
    <i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> pom.xml</pre>

    <p>Change the project version in <code>pom.xml</code> to <code>1.0</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">&ltversion&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;</pre>

    <p>Next, add <a href="http://flywaydb.org">Flyway</a> as a dependency to <code>pom.xml</code> so we can create the
        database schema we'll need:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.flywaydb&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;flyway-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>

    <p>And create a migration as <code>src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__Messages.sql</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">CREATE TABLE messages (
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  msg TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO messages (id, msg) VALUES (1, 'Greetings from Spring Boot auto-configured by Boxfuse!');</pre>

    <p>Then add a simple controller to <code>boxfusedemo.DatabaseDemoApplication</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">package boxfusedemo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class DatabaseDemoApplication {
    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource).queryForObject("select msg from messages where id=?", String.class, 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DatabaseDemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}</pre>

    <p>And last but not least, compile it into an executable jar file:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> mvnw package -DskipTests</pre>

    <p>Great. Your Spring Boot microservice executable jar is now available under
        <code>target/database-demo-1.0.jar</code>.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Fusing a Boxfuse image and running it on VirtualBox</h2>

    <p>Now it's time to fuse your application into a Boxfuse image and launch an instance of it on VirtualBox:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run

Fusing Image for database-demo-1.0.jar ...
Image fused in 00:07.373s (56827 K) -> myuser/database-demo:1.0
Downloading boxfuse-dev-hdd 20160123 ...

Creating Boxfuse Dev VM for myuser/database-demo ...

Waiting for Payload to start on Instance vb-db91551d ...
Payload started in 00:13.157s -> http://127.0.0.1:8080</pre>

    <h3>What just happened here?</h3>

    <p>Boxfuse detected the Maven project structure and automatically found the executable jar. Boxfuse then determined
        that this is a Spring Boot application that includes the PostgreSQL driver and automatically configured it to
        require a PostgreSQL database. It then fused our application's executable into a minimal bootable VM image.</p>

    <p>Before starting an instance of our image, Boxfuse installed and launched a dev VM that contains a
        fully-configured
        PostgreSQL database. The PostgreSQL service from that VM was then exposed to our app on port 5432.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/databases/dev-vm.png">
    </div>

    <p>Boxfuse then launched a VM instance of our application's image and automatically injected the correct database
        URL, user and password as environment variables. Those environment variables were then picked up by our Spring
        Boot application
        to instantiate and autowire the datasource required by our small rest controller.</p>

    <h3>Seeing it in action</h3>

    <p>To see our controller in action, simply point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080 or type:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse open</pre>

    <p>And here our service successfully returning the record from our freshly created and migrated database:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/posts/databases/controller.png">
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Deploying to AWS</h2>

    <p>Now let's deploy our microservice to AWS. As Boxfuse works with your AWS account, it first needs the necessary
        permissions to do so.
        So if you haven't already done it, go to the Boxfuse Console and <strong><a
                href="https://console.boxfuse.com/#/awsAccount">connect your AWS account</a></strong> now.</p>

    <p>Every new Boxfuse account comes with 3 environments: <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code>.
        <code>dev</code> is your local VirtualBox environment and <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code> are on AWS.
    </p>

    <p>So let's deploy our microservice to the <code>prod</code> environment on AWS:</p>

    <pre class="console" style="font-size: 86%"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod

Creating myuser/database-demo ...
Pushing myuser/database-demo:1.0 ...
Verifying myuser/database-demo:1.0 ...

Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...
Deployment completed successfully. myuser/database-demo:1.0 is up and running at http://databasedemo-myuser.boxfuse.io:8080/</pre>

    <h3>What just happened here?</h3>

    <p>Boxfuse pushed our image to the secure Boxfuse Vault. Boxfuse then <strong>automatically provisioned an <a
            href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/">RDS PostgreSQL</a>
        database</strong> (and its associated security group). It then went on to create an AMI for our image. Once our
        database
        was ready, Boxfuse then create a new domain name and mapped it to a new elastic ip. It then created a security
        group
        four our app and launch an instance of our AMI.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/databases/rds.png">
    </div>

    <p>Boxfuse <strong>automatically injected the correct database
        URL, user and password</strong> as environment variables. Those environment variables were then picked up by our
        Spring
        Boot application to once again instantiate and autowire the datasource required by our small rest controller.
    </p>


    <h3>Seeing it in action</h3>

    <p>Once again, to see our controller in action, simply type:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse open -env=prod</pre>

    <p>And here our service successfully returning the record from our freshly created and migrated database:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/posts/databases/controller-aws.png">
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Making our database highly available</h2>

    <p>Finally let's make sure our infrastructure can survive in the face of failure. To
        achieve that we're going to make our database highly available by provisioning a <strong>continuously replicated
            geo-redundant hot standby spare instance</strong> that's ready take over in case the primary one fails.</p>

    <p>To achieve this we'll simply scale our database in the <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse Console</a>:
    </p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/posts/databases/multiaz.png">
    </div>

    <p>And that's it! Not only is our database now able to automatically fail-over, but we now also get near
        zero-downtime (typically only a few seconds)
        when patching or minor version upgrades are required.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Summary</h2>

    <p>In this post, we introduced Boxfuse's new <strong>dead-easy database management capabilities</strong>.</p>

    <p>Boxfuse is now able to automatically provision PostgreSQL databases both locally and on AWS RDS. Boxfuse exposes
        the database URL, user and password as environment variables within the application instances. And if your
        application
        is based on Spring Boot, Grails, Play or Dropwizard, Boxfuse will automatically configure your frameworks's
        default
        datasource with those settings.</p>

    <p>Finally making your database highly available and scaling both the instance type and the allocated storage is now
        a breeze.
        All it takes is a few clicks in the Boxfuse Console.</p>

    <p>So if you haven't already,
        <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com"><strong>sign up for your
            Boxfuse account</strong></a> now (simply log in with your GitHub id, it's free) and start deploying
        your applications and their PostgreSQL databases effortlessly on AWS today.
