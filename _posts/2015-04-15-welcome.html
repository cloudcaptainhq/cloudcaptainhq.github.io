    <p>After a lot of hard work, we are excited to announce Boxfuse!</p>

    <p><strong>Boxfuse redefines the Operating System, Provisioning and Application Deployment</strong> by adopting a fresh approach
    designed from the ground up for a modern cloud-based world <strong>without lock-in</strong>. Images are measured in MBs and generated in seconds.
    Deployment are blue/green and transactional with zero downtime. Welcome to the future.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">The End of the general-purpose Operating System</h2>

    <p><strong>Boxfuse eliminates the general-purpose operating system</strong> and replaces it with a Linux-kernel
        based system that is just a few MBs in size. No more bloat and unnecessary baggage. No more cargo cult. These images are as lean as they get.</p>

    </div>

    <p>A Boxfuse image is <strong>just 1% of the size</strong> of a legacy general-purpose operating system.
        It is <strong>faster</strong> to transfer, <strong>cheaper</strong> to archive and, by drastically reducing the attach surface, much more <strong>secure</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">The End of Traditional Provisioning</h2>

    <p><strong>Boxfuse eliminates traditional provisioning</strong> by generating bootable images for your applications in seconds.
        No more Chef and Puppet. Instead Boxfuse analyses your app and <strong>generates the perfect immutable image</strong> for it, <strong>in seconds</strong>, every single time.
    </p>

        <img src="/assets/img/learn/fuse.png" alt="Fuse">
    </div>

    <p>Boxfuse image generation is on average <strong>100x faster</strong> than traditional provisioning. Instead of taking
    hours or minutes, generating an image takes just <strong>5 seconds</strong>. You don't need sysadmin knowledge
    and you don't have to write complex recipes. All it takes is <strong>one command</strong>. And yes, it runs on Windows, Mac &amp; Linux.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Application Deployment Reinvented</h2>

    <p><strong>Boxfuse redefines application deployment</strong> and replaces it by a clean bootable Image-based model,
        where every Image is rolled out using a highly reliable transactional blue/green deployment with a Zero Downtime transition.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/img/learn/deploy.png" alt="Deploy">
    </div>

    <p>Boxfuse deploys Images to ensure <strong>all systems are identical in all environments</strong>, down to the last bit.
    This is eliminates a common source of errors. Once generated you can now run the exact same Image locally in development on VirtualBox
    as you you will run in production on AWS.</p>

    <p>Deployment on VirtualBox takes just a few seconds, and a <strong>Zero-Downtime update on AWS</strong> usually completes in <strong>under 90 seconds</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">No more Lock-in</h2>

    <p><strong>Boxfuse eliminates lock in</strong> by working with your applications in their native formats and your AWS account. Say goodbye to walled gardens and proprietary formats.</p>

    <p>At Boxfuse we strongly believe you should be able to pick the <strong>best tool for the job</strong> without
    needing to rewrite your application or having to constrain yourself to a walled garden. We built Boxfuse to help you solve
    the <strong>heavy lifting of deployment</strong> using the <strong>open technologies and platforms</strong> you love.</p>

    <p>There is <strong>no lock-in</strong> and there are <strong>no long term commitments</strong>. You can leave anytime you like, but you won't want to.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Get Started</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse is available now.</p>

    <p>We are launching with support for <strong>JVM</strong> apps packaged as either <strong>war files on Tomcat</strong> or <strong>executable jar</strong> files.
        You can <strong>generate Boxfuse micro Images on Windows, Mac or Linux</strong>.
        And you can run them unchanged on <strong>VirtualBox and AWS</strong>.</p>

    <p>We created a <strong>free tier that maps perfectly onto AWS' free tier</strong>, so you can get started at no cost.</p>
