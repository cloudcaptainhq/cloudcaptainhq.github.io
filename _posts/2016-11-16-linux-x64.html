<p>Boxfuse is all about effortlessly deploying your applications so they just work. This is made possible by a combination of intelligent minimal image creating
    using deep integration with popular frameworks and language runtimes as well as seamless orchestration of blue/green deployments on AWS.</p>

<p>There are however a number of languages and frameworks we don't specifically support yet. So far this meant that if you weren't
    using the <a href="/docs/payloads/springboot">JVM</a>, <a href="/docs/payloads/nodejs">Node.js</a> or <a href="/docs/payloads/elf64">Go</a> you were out of luck.</p>

<p>Today we are introducing <strong>generic Linux x64 apps support</strong>. You can now deploy any Linux x64 app you like
    and enjoy Boxfuse's great AWS integration including <a href="/blog/amis-in-30-seconds">ultra-fast AMI creation</a>,
    blue/green deployment, <a href="/blog/auto-scaling">auto-scaling</a> and more.</p>

<h2>Seeing it in action</h2>
<p>Let's dive in and look at how you can deploy any Linux x64 app using Boxfuse.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this we are going to run Nginx on AWS. To do so we'll need two things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a tar.gz file containing the app we want to run (in this case Nginx)</li>
    <li>the command required to start the app</li>
</ul>

<p>For this demo we'll use a Linux x64 build of Nginx available from this <a href="https://github.com/micw/nginx-static-1.5.x">page on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To fuse an image and run it on AWS all we need to do is pass the command to start it and which port to open:</p>

<pre class="console" style="font-size: 95%"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run nginx-static-1.5.tgz "-cmd=nginx-static/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon off; user root;'" -ports.http=80

<strong class="success">Successfully deployed myuser/nginx-static:1.5 in prod at http://nginxstatic-myuser.boxfuse.io/</strong></pre>

<p>And here we go! We created a <strong>10 MB image</strong> containing a boot loader, the Linux kernel and Nginx in <strong>0.7 seconds</strong>.
Boxfuse then <strong>deployed it on AWS by creating all necessary infrastructure</strong> including a custom domain name,
    an elastic IP, security groups, an AMI, a t2.micro instance and more in <strong>under 60 seconds</strong> total.</p>

<p>And here it is up and running:</p>

<p>All of this in under one minute from start to finish with just a single command. And best of all, all subsequent
    updates will always be performed using <a href="/learn/how">zero downtime blue/green deployments</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Boxfuse now let's you <strong>deploy any Linux x64 app you want</strong> with the same orchestration features already
    available to JVM, Node.js and Go apps including <a href="/blog/amis-in-30-seconds">ultra-fast AMI creation</a>,
    blue/green deployment, <a href="/blog/auto-scaling">auto-scaling</a> and more.</p>

<p>Simply package your app as a tar.gz, pass the command required to start it and Boxfuse will get you up and running on AWS in no time.</p>
