    <p>At its core, Boxfuse <a href="/learn/how"><strong>analyses the payload you pass it</strong></a> (like a .jar or .war file) and generates a minimal immutable
        image for it. This image contains two main parts: a disk image and metadata.</p>
    <p>The metadata is what interests us here.
        It is built as part of the analysis phase and contains information about your app, such as the ports
        and the healthcheck urls it requires. If you use <a href="/docs/payloads/springboot">Spring Boot</a> or
        <a href="/docs/payloads/dropwizard">Dropwizard</a> this info can even be automatically extracted for you from
        these frameworks' native configuration files.
    </p>
    <p>Boxfuse then later uses this metadata when running instances of your images to correctly provision infrastructure.
    In the case of <a href="/docs/aws">AWS</a>, Boxfuse will use the port and healthcheck info to automatically set up and configure Elastic Load Balancers,
    Security Groups and more.</p>

    <p>However so far, unless you explicitly <a href="/docs/commandline/cfg">configured a custom security group</a>, any port you have opened was always open to the world:</p>

    </div>

    <p>While this is great for publicly facing parts of the service like http(s) ports it may not always be what you want for other parts of it like the admin interface for example.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Restricted Ports</h2>

    <p>Today we are introducing a new Boxfuse feature called <strong>Restricted Ports</strong>. What this allows you, is
    to further constrain the access rights of a specific port down to a specific range of ip addresses.</p>
    <p>We have added
    support for <strong>fixed addresses</strong> like <code>12.34.56.78</code> as well as
        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a> blocks</strong> such as <code>12.34.56.00/24</code>
        (granting access to all ip addresses between <code>12.34.56.00</code> and <code>12.34.56.255</code>).</p>
    <p>Additionally we have also added support for a special address denoted by <code>@</code>, which refers to the
        <strong>current public ip of your local workstation</strong>. This is particularly useful when working with protocols which lack
    authentication such as JVMTI for debugging. You can now open a debug port that is only accessible from your own
    IP address.</p>
    <p>If your ISP assigns you dynamic addresses you can combine these approaches and grant access to the CIDR block
    of your current IP such as <code>@/22</code>.</p>
    <p>This is how this then works out in practice if you want to for example restrict the access of the admin port of
    your app to the current ip of your workstation:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/restricted-ports/restricted.png" alt="Ports restricted to your workstation">
    </div>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">UDP Ports</h2>

    <p>Another feature we added is support for <strong>UDP</strong> as not every service needs the additional features
    (and overhead) of TCP. To achieve this you can simply add <code>/udp</code> to the port definition:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse run -ports.myudpsrvc=<strong>6543/udp</strong></pre>

    <p>This will then effectively expose UDP port 6543 to the world. This is of course combinable with the restricted ports described above.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Summary</h2>

    <p>While certain protocols or interfaces aren't meant to be publicly available, yet are an important part of
        your application, we have introduced <strong>Restricted Ports</strong> to make it easy to constrain access
        to a single address or a CIDR block. We have also added support for the convenience value <code>@</code> to easily
    refer to the current public ip address of your workstation. On top of that it is now possible to also open <strong>UDP</strong> ports.</p>

    <p>Here is for reference the complete list of currently supported syntax variants for port definition:</p>

    <table class="table">
        <tr><td><code>80</code></td><td>TCP port 80, universally accessible</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>80/tcp</code></td><td>TCP port 80, universally accessible</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>80/udp</code></td><td>UDP port 80, universally accessible</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>80/tcp:@</code></td><td>TCP port 80 only accessible from your own IP</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>80/udp:@/20</code></td><td>UDP port 80 only accessible from the IPs in the CIDR /20 block of your own IP</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>80/udp:1.2.3.4</code></td><td>UDP port 80 only accessible from 1.2.3.4</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>80/tcp:1.2.3.4/31</code></td><td>TCP port 80 only accessible from the IPs in the CIDR /31 block of 1.2.3.4</td></tr>
    </table>
