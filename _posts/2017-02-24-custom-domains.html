<p>To get your JVM, Node.js or Go application up and running quickly and effortlessly on AWS all you need to do is type</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod</pre>

<p>This will provision all necessary resources, deploy your application and make it available under a brand new
    <code>boxfuse.io</code> subdomain like <code>myapp-mygreatcompany.boxfuse.io</code>. But wouldn't it be great
if you could make it available under <code>myapp.com</code> or <code>myapp.mygreatcompany.com</code> instead?</p>

<p>Until now this meant manually creating a new CNAME record in your DNS that would point to your boxfuse.io subdomain
    which in turn would point to the underlying AWS resource.</p>

<p>No more. Today we are introducing dead easy first-class support for <strong>custom domains</strong> using AWS Route 53.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>First of all, ensure you have registered your domain using Route 53 or that you are using Route 53 for managing your domain's DNS.</p>

<p>From here on things couldn't be easier. Simply go to your application in the <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse Console</a>
and configure it for the environment you want:</p>

<p>And now simply select the domain of your choice from the list and your app will be deployed at <code>mygreatcompany.com</code>.
    And if you want to use a new subdomain that's easy too. Simply type the name of the subdomain in the textbox and voila!
    Your app will be deployed at <code>myapp.mygreatcompany.com</code>.
</p>

<p>Those domains now point directly at the underlying AWS Elastic IP or Elastic Load Balancer.</p>

<h2>Using the Boxfuse Client</h2>

<p>If you prefer to use the Boxfuse Client instead, you can simply specify the domain as follows:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod <strong>-domain=myapp.mygreatcompany.com</strong></pre>

<p>And if you lean towards <strong>infrastructure as code</strong> simply place it in your <code>boxfuse.conf</code> file
    which you can check in to version control along with your sources:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">domain=myapp.mygreatcompany.com</pre>

<h2>Available today</h2>
