The [initial release of Boxfuse](/blog/welcome) was in 2015. From then on Boxfuse's feature set grew steadily as we
added support for additional payload types, additional AWS regions, additional AWS instance families, additional app
types and more!

## Transition and Improvements

In 2019, we sold the Flyway part of our business and entered a long transition phase. During this time our attention was
more divided than we would have liked, yet we still managed to [deliver a number of major improvements](/docs/releasenotes)
including:
- lightning fast AMI creation, usually in under 10 seconds
- OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17 support
- m6i, r6i, c6i EC2 instances support
- db.t4g RDS instances support

## Introducing CloudCaptain

Today we are happy to announce that this transition phase has ended!

As part of this, please join us in saying goodbye to Boxfuse and welcoming CloudCaptain!

As you no doubt have noticed the old `boxfuse.com` domain has now been phased out and replaced by our brand new
[cloudcaptain.sh](https://cloudcaptain.sh) where development will continue at an accelerated pace going forward!

We have lots of innovation in store and we can't wait to share it with you!
