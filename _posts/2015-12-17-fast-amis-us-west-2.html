    <p>When we <a href="/blog/welcome">first launched Boxfuse</a> we immediately introduced support for all AWS regions,
        but only one of them was optimized for <a href="/blog/amis-in-30-seconds">AMI creation speed</a> (<strong>eu-central-1</strong>).</p>

    <p>As Boxfuse usage grew, we <a href="/blog/fast-amis-us-east-1">expanded our fast AMI creation capabilities to
    <strong>us-east-1</strong> and <strong>eu-west-1</strong></a> to meet customer demand.</p>

    <p>So why is it important to have a region optimized for speed?</p>

    <p>We'll let the numbers speak for themselves:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/fast-amis-us-west-2/ami-creation-time-comparison-boxfuse-packer.png" alt="Boxfuse vs Packer AMI creation speed">
    </div>

    <p>As you can see even though even the slowest Boxfuse regions are already <a href="/vs/packer">faster than Packer</a>,
    moving to a Boxfuse optimised region gives you a major boost, bringing AMI creation to about 30 seconds,
        which is an order of magnitude faster than most other tools in the industry.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Expanding fast AMI creation to us-west-2</h2>

    <p>Starting today, you can now also enjoy the same ultra-fast AMI creation performance in the <strong>us-west-2</strong>
    region. No need to change anything on your end. Simply fire up your Boxfuse Client
        and start enjoying the ultra-fast performance now:</p>

    <p>As Boxfuse expands its footprint, further regions will be optimized for fast deployment. The order will be based on based on customer usage and demand.
        This does not affect the runtime speed of your instance, which is determined by the instance type you selected.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We have taken Boxfuse's ultra-fast AMI creation capabilities in the <strong>eu-central-1</strong>,
        <strong>us-east-1</strong> and <strong>eu-west-1</strong> regions and
        expanded them to the <strong>us-west-2</strong> region. No change is necessary on
        your end. Simply use Boxfuse to <a href="/docs/commandline/convert">create AMIs</a> and <a href="/docs/commandline/run">deploy applications</a>
        as you always do and automatically start enjoying the absolute fastest way to create AMIs today.</p>
