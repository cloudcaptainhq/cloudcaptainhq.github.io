    <p>The main cornerstone to making the transition to <strong><a href="/learn/why">Immutable Infrastructure</a></strong>
        a success is having the capability to produce machine images quickly and reliably These images can then be deployed
        across environments and ensure perfect <strong>environment parity</strong> from dev to prod.</p>

    <p>Boxfuse has from the get-go been able to <strong><a href="/learn/how">produce minimal machine images tailor-made for your applications</a></strong> on the
    OS of your choice. No matter whether you choose to use Windows, Mac or Linux, Boxfuse always produces the same consistent
    and reliable images in under 10 seconds.</p>

    <p>You can then run VirtualBox instances based on those images locally to iterate rapidly.</p>

    <p>Once you are satisfied with the results, you can then <a href="/docs/commandline/push">push these images to the Boxfuse Vault</a>
        and <a href="/docs/commandline/convert">convert them to AWS AMIs</a> to be able to launch instances on EC2.</p>

    <p>Boxfuse has always been about an <a href="/blog/amis-in-30-seconds"><strong>order of magnitude faster than other competing products</strong></a> when performing this
        conversion in the <strong>eu-central-1</strong> region:</p>

    <p>Starting today, you can now also enjoy the same ultra-fast AMI creation performance in the <strong>us-east-1</strong>
    and <strong>eu-west-1</strong> regions. No need to change anything on your end. Simply fire up your Boxfuse Client
        and start enjoying the ultra-fast performance now:</p>

    <p>As Boxfuse expands its footprint, further regions will be optimized for fast deployment. The order will be based on based on customer usage and demand.
        This does not affect the runtime speed of your instance, which is determined by the instance type you selected.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We have taken Boxfuse's ultra-fast AMI creation capabilities in the <strong>eu-central-1</strong> region and
        expanded them to the <strong>us-east-1</strong> and <strong>eu-west-1</strong> regions. No change is necessary on
        your end. Simply use Boxfuse to <a href="/docs/commandline/convert">create AMIs</a> and <a href="/docs/commandline/run">deploy applications</a>
        as you always do and automatically start enjoying the absolute fastest way to create AMIs today.</p>
