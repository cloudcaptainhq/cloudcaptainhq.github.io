<p>Until now Boxfuse came with support for two types of applications: <code>single-instance</code> and <code>load-balanced</code>.</p>

<p><code>single-instance</code> applications sit behind an Elastic IP address and are updated with zero-downtime
    blue/green deployments. Even though they lack runtime redundancy, they are great for non-critical workloads
    typically involving HTTP or HTTPS requests.</p>

<p><code>load-balanced</code> applications on the other hand sit behind an Elastic Load Balancer. Not only are they
also updated with zero-downtime blue/green deployments, but they also come with runtime-redundancy, zero-downtime auto-recovery
and auto-scaling. They are a great choice for robust and demanding HTTP and HTTPS workloads.</p>

<p>While <code>single-instance</code> and <code>load-balanced</code> apps serve quite a lot of needs, there are times when
    you simply don't need a stable entry point in your application. For those scenarios having an extra Elastic IP or ELB
    simply adds unnecessary complexity and costs.</p>

<p>To address this, today we are introducing a third kind of application: <code>worker</code> apps.</p>

<h2>Introducing Worker Apps</h2>

<p><code>worker</code> apps come with the same reliability advantages as <code>load-balanced</code> apps. They
    are updated with zero-downtime blue/green deployments and they come with runtime-redundancy, zero-downtime auto-recovery
    and auto-scaling. However, they don't have an Elastic Load Balancer in front of them.</p>

<p>Let's look at 3 scenarios where they are particularly useful.</p>

<h2>Client-side load balancing</h2>

<p>When Netflix decided to go all-in on AWS, it was still early days for the cloud. At that time ELBs could only be
internet facing, and simply weren't a great choice for internal communication between services like they are today.</p>

<p>Those needs sparked the creation of a number of open-source tools to address them including <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a>. You can think of Eureka as a central place where
    instances services can register themselves with, so they can be discovered by clients. Ribbon is a library that you run
on the client that will then take care of load balancing calls between multiple instances of the same service that were discovered
    via Eureka.</p>

<p>To make it easier to run setups like the one above locally, we have also made changes to the way we handle networking
with VirtualBox. With VirtualBox 5.1 and newer all instances in the dev environment will now receive their own unique IP address
with a dedicated NAT network and will be able to talk directly to each other.</p>

<h2>Queues</h2>
<p>Another common scenario for <code>worker</code> apps is queueing. In this case services communicate asynchronously with
each other via queues. These could be SQS queues or any other async solution. <code>worker</code> apps can be great
message consumers and their autoscaling capabilities can be a great fit for dealing with varying loads.</p>

<h2>Cron jobs</h2>
<p>Finally we also have periodic tasks, or cron jobs, where the trigger is time based. Even if it is just a single instance
running, the auto-scaling group of a worker app will comes in handy to automatically restart a new one should the old one die.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>With <code>worker</code> apps, you now have a third kind of application available. Unlike <code>single-instance</code>
    and <code>load-balanced</code> apps they do not have an Elastic IP or ELB as an entry point as this is simply not needed
    for a number of scenarios including client-side load balancing, queue consumers and cron job-driven apps. In those
    cases <code>worker</code> apps reduce both cost and complexity.</p>

<p>So go ahead and launch a new <code>worker</code> app today! And if you haven't signed up already, simply
