    <p>Groovy, Grails and Gradle together form an excellent and highly productive platform for developing modern web applications.
    </p>

    <p>Today we're going to look at <strong>deploying Grails applications</strong> written in <strong>Groovy</strong> effortlessly to <strong>AWS</strong>
        using <strong>Gradle</strong> and <a href="/blog/welcome">Boxfuse</a>.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/grails-aws/grails-to-aws.png" alt="Grails App deployed to AWS using Gradle and Boxfuse">
    </div>

    <p>We'll do so using the 3 core principles behind Boxfuse:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td><a href="/learn/why"><strong><nobr>Immutable Infrastructure</nobr></strong></a></td>
            <td>Creating servers and never modifying them again by treating a server as one immutable
                unit that is regenerated after every change and promoted unchanged from environment to environment.
                This eliminates drift and increases reliability by ensuring you run the exact same code in production as
                the code you tested in test.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td><a href="/learn/how"><strong>Minimal Images</strong></a></td>
            <td>Analysing your application and generating minimal tailor-made Linux-based images on the fly that
                are 100x smaller than a typical Linux system and take just seconds to produce.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td><strong>Blue/Green deployments</strong></td>
            <td>Deploying a new version of an app in parallel to the existing one and only making the switch at the elastic IP
                or elastic load balancer level once the configured health checks of the new version have passed. Deployments are fully
                automated and effectively transactional, providing you with zero-downtime updates.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>The plan</h2>
    <p>Our plan is to first <strong>create a new Grails app</strong> which we'll <strong>fuse into a minimal Boxfuse image</strong> that can be deployed unchanged both on VirtualBox and AWS.</p>

    <p>We'll then <strong>deploy our image to VirtualBox</strong> (great for rapid feedback and quick local tests),
        push it to the Boxfuse Vault (our secure online repository) and <strong>run it on AWS</strong>.</p>

    <p>And finally we'll <strong>update it on AWS with zero-downtime</strong> blue/green deployments.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>Before we get started ensure you have <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">created a Boxfuse account</a> (it's free, just log in with your GitHub id).
        Also make sure to associate it with your <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a> in the <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse console</a> to be able to deploy on EC2.</p>
    <p>You will also need a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK</a>,
        <a href="https://grails.org/download.html">Grails</a>
        and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> installed on your machine.</p>

    <h2>Step 0: Creating a Grails application</h2>

    <p>Start by creating a Grails application:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> grails create-app getstarted-grails</pre>

    <p>Navigate to the newly created directory:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> cd getstarted-grails</pre>

    <p>And build an executable jar file:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> grails war</pre>

    <p>Great. Your Grails application executable jar is now available under <code>build/libs/getstarted-grails-0.1.jar</code>.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Fusing a Boxfuse image and running it on VirtualBox</h2>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/grails-aws/minimal-image.png" alt="Grails App to Boxfuse Minimal Image">
    </div>

    <p>Before we can begin we first have to add the <a href="/docs/gradle">Boxfuse Gradle plugin</a> to our <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">plugins {
    id "com.boxfuse.client" version "{{site.boxfuseVersion}}"
    ...
}

boxfuse {
    // You can find these in the Downloads tab of the Boxfuse Console (https://console.boxfuse.com/#/downloads)
    user='your-boxfuse-client-user'
    secret='your-boxfuse-client-secret'
}</pre>

    <p>Now it's time to fuse your application into a Boxfuse image and launch an instance of it on VirtualBox:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> gradle boxfuseRun</pre>

    <p>This command <strong>analyses your application and generates a minimal Linux-based image</strong> for it. It does this by combining
        your application itself with a JRE and a Linux kernel from the Boxfuse Component Inventory. It will then
        launch an instance of your new image on VirtualBox. This entire process should take <strong>around 10 seconds</strong>.</p>
    <p>When it completes you simply open a browser pointing to your fresh new VirtualBox VM:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> gradle boxfuseOpen</pre>

    <p>And here it is:</p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/getstarted/grails-virtualbox.png">

    <p>The port this instance is running on wasn't picked by chance. <strong>Boxfuse analyses your native <code>application.yml</code> Grails config file</strong>
    and automatically extracts the correct port and healthcheck configuration.</p>

    <p>You can also see this information in your list of images:</p>

    <pre class="console" style="font-size: 78%"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> gradle boxfuseLs

Images available locally:
+------------------------------+---------------------------+-------+---------+-----------+--------------+---------+---------------------+

Total: 1</pre>

    <p>As well as in the list of running instances:</p>

    <pre class="console" style="font-size: 78%"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> gradle boxfusePs

Running Instances on VirtualBox in the dev environment :
+-------------+------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
|  Instance   |            Image             |        Type         |          URL          |     Launched at     |
+-------------+------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+

+-------------+------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
Total: 1</pre>

    <h2>Step 2: Deploying your application to AWS</h2>

    <p>Now let's deploy your image to AWS. As Boxfuse works with your AWS account, it first needs the necessary permissions to do so.
        So if you haven't already done it, go to the Boxfuse Console and <strong><a href="https://console.boxfuse.com/#/awsAccount">connect your AWS account</a></strong> now.</p>

    <p>Every new Boxfuse account comes with 3 environments: <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code>.
        <code>dev</code> is your local VirtualBox environment and <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code> are on AWS.</p>

    <p>So let's deploy our application to the <code>prod</code> environment on AWS:</p>

    <pre class="console" style="font-size: 78%"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> gradle boxfuseRun -Dboxfuse.env=prod -i

...
Pushing myuser/getstarted-grails:0.1 ...
Verifying myuser/getstarted-grails:0.1 ...
Waiting for AWS to create an AMI for myuser/getstarted-grails:0.1 in eu-central-1 (this may take up to 50 seconds) ...
AMI created in 00:19.095s in eu-central-1 -> ami-fd5b4491

Creating security group boxsg-myuser-prod-getstarted-grails-0.1 ...
Launching t2.micro instance of myuser/getstarted-grails:0.1 (ami-fd5b4491) in prod (eu-central-1) ...
Instance launched in 00:50.707s -> i-2c1daf90
Waiting for AWS to boot Instance i-2c1daf90 and Payload to start at http://52.59.247.126:8080/health ...
Payload started in 00:55.567s -> http://52.59.247.126:8080/health
Remapping Elastic IP 52.29.77.147 to i-2c1daf90 ...
Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...
Deployment completed successfully. myuser/getstarted-grails:0.1 is up and running at http://getstartedgrails-myuser.boxfuse.io:8080/</pre>

    <p>With that one command Boxfuse has automatically pushed your existing image to the Boxfuse Vault, the Boxfuse secure only image repository,
        as well as <strong>provisioned,
        configured and secured all necessary AWS resources</strong> including a domain name, an elastic IP, a security group and
        your instance itself. There is no manual work necessary on your behalf.</p>

    <p>Once again <strong>Boxfuse automatically used the port and healthcheck information extracted from your <code>application.yml</code> Grails configuration</strong> file.</p>

    <p>All you need to do now is simply navigate to your new domain to see your Grails application in action on AWS:</p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/getstarted/grails-aws.png">

    <h2>Step 3: Updating your application using blue/green deployments</h2>

    <p>Now let's take things one step further and update your application on AWS with <strong>zero downtime</strong> using blue/green deployments.</p>

    <p>This fits perfectly with our model of <strong>immutable infrastructure</strong> where we never update an instance in-place, and instead launch a new one to replace it.
    <strong>The new instance is only put into service once all healthchecks have passed</strong> and it has proven to be fit for the job. This ensures to you always
    have a working application up and running serving your users.</p>

    <p>So first let's update our app by modifying <code>grails-app/views/index.gsp</code> and change the title:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Grails on Boxfuse!&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>

    <p>then bump the version in <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">version "0.2"</pre>

    <p>and rebuild the jar and fuse a new Boxfuse image:

    <pre class="console" style="font-size: 78%"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> grails clean
<span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> gradle boxfuseFuse -Dboxfuse.env=prod</pre>

         <p>Finally deploy the new version of your application to AWS:</p>
    <pre class="console" style="font-size: 78%"><span>getstarted-grails&gt;</span> gradle boxfuseRun -Dboxfuse.env=prod -i

...
Pushing myuser/getstarted-grails:0.2 ...
Verifying myuser/getstarted-grails:0.2 ...
Waiting for AWS to create an AMI for myuser/getstarted-grails:0.2 in eu-central-1 (this may take up to 50 seconds) ...
AMI created in 00:18.013s in eu-central-1 -> ami-7b5a4517
Creating security group boxsg-myuser-prod-getstarted-grails-0.2 ...
Launching t2.micro instance of myuser/getstarted-grails:0.2 (ami-7b5a4517) in prod (eu-central-1) ...
Instance launched in 00:41.174s -> i-b502b009
Waiting for AWS to boot Instance i-b502b009 and Payload to start at http://52.59.254.138:8080/health ...
Payload started in 01:27.645s -> http://52.59.254.138:8080/health
Remapping Elastic IP 52.29.77.147 to i-b502b009 ...
Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...

Deployment completed successfully. myuser/getstarted-grails:0.2 is up and running at http://getstartedgrails-myuser.boxfuse.io:8080/</pre>

    <p>And there it is:</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Summary</h2>

    <p>In this post, we saw how to <strong>deploy and update a Grails application to AWS</strong> using <strong>Gradle</strong> and <strong>Boxfuse</strong> in 3 easy steps. First
    we fused our application into a Boxfuse minimal image and ran an instance of it on VirtualBox. We then
    deployed the same image unchanged to AWS. And finally we updated our application on AWS with zero downtime using
    blue/green deployments.</p>

    <p>To do so we used <strong><a href="/">Boxfuse</a></strong> and its 3 core principles:
