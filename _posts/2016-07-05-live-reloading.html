    At Boxfuse we strongly believe in optimizing for developer productivity. This means easy of use, robustness and performance.
    This is the reason we worked tirelessly to bring you <a href="/blog/nodejs-aws">2 second image generation for Node.js apps</a>,
    <a href="/blog/debug">dead easy debugging and profiling</a> and more.
</p>

<p>Today we are taking things further by introducing support for <strong>Live Reloading</strong> in the <a href="/docs/environments">dev environment</a>.</p>

<p>This is all about reducing cycle time by enabling super-fast turnarounds. When you are in the middle of developing
    something you want to be able to experiment and see results as fast as possible. To enable this, we are introducing
    a new type of image called <strong>live images</strong>. They can be fused from a directory instead of an archive.
    This directory will usually be the output directory of your IDE or your general project directory.
    Instances launched from live images automatically keep track of the changes
    you make to that directory and ensure that those <strong>changes are now visible immediately</strong>, without
    the need to go through a full kill/fuse/run cycle.</p>

<h2>How do Live Images work?</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/fuse-live.png" title="fuse -live" alt="fuse -live"></p>

<p>Live images achieve their magic by combining two techniques:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>mounting your application files directory</strong> as a live directory within your instance</li>
    <li>adding a <strong>reloading agent</strong> to your instance to reload your application when needed</li>
</ol>

<p>For <strong>JVM apps</strong>, Boxfuse supports mounting exploded jars, exploded wars and exploded Play zips directly into your instance. Additionally Boxfuse automatically
    configures your JVM to use the <strong>Spring Loaded</strong> Java Agent for automatically reloading classes when the underlying class file changes.</p>

<p>For <strong>Node.js apps</strong>, Boxfuse supports mounting your Node.js application directory (the one containing <code>package.json</code>) directly into your instance.
    Additionally, Boxfuse automatically starts your Node.js app with <strong>node-supervisor</strong> to ensure it is properly restarted
    whenever js files change.
</p>

<h2>Seeing it in Action</h2>

<p>Let's have a look at how this works in practice. For this we're going to use a simple Node.js app using Express.</p>

<p>Start by installing Express:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; npm install -g express-generator</pre>

<p>Then create the app:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; express live-reloading-test</pre>

<p>And navigate to its directory:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; cd live-reloading-test</pre>

<p>Ensure all dependent modules have been downloaded locally:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; npm install</pre>

<p>Then <strong>fuse and run a live image</strong> of the directory by using <code>-live</code>:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse run <strong>-live</strong>

...

vb-2656d939 => node-supervisor -t -s -k ./bin/www
vb-2656d939 =>
vb-2656d939 => Running node-supervisor with
vb-2656d939 =>   program './bin/www'
vb-2656d939 =>   --watch '.'
vb-2656d939 =>   --non-interactive
vb-2656d939 =>   --extensions 'node,js,/bin/www'
vb-2656d939 =>   --exec 'node'
vb-2656d939 =>
vb-2656d939 => Starting child process with 'node ./bin/www'
vb-2656d939 => Watching directory '/live' for changes.
Payload started in 00:02.395s -> http://127.0.0.1</pre>

<p>You can now see your new live instance up and running:</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/posts/live-reloading/instance.png"></p>

<p>Now go ahead and modify <code>routes/index.js</code> by changing the title:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  <del>res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });</del>
  <strong>res.render('index', { title: 'Boxfuse Live Reloading' });</strong>
});

module.exports = router;</pre>

<p>As soon as you save the file you'll see this in the instance logs:</p>

<pre class="console">vb-2656d939 => crashing child with SIGKILL
vb-2656d939 => Thu Jul 07 2016 07:11:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
vb-2656d939 => Starting child process with 'node ./bin/www'</pre>

<p>Finally simply refresh the browser to see the changes <strong>instantly</strong> without fusing a new image:</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/posts/live-reloading/instance-reloaded.png"></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>With <strong>Live Reloading</strong> you can now have super fast roundtrips by making changes to your project directory and seeing them immediately
within your instance. This is a huge boost for productivity in development and it is available now on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.</p>
