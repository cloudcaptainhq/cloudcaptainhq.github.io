AWS lets you associate useful metadata with your provisioned resources in the form of tags. By default Boxfuse uses
this to consistently tag your AMIs, EBS snapshots, EBS volumes, ELBs, Instances, Auto Scaling Groups, 
Launch Configurations, RDS databases, RDS snapshots and more.
 
Boxfuse does so using a combination of the following tags:

{: .table .table-striped}

AWS Tag Name | Description | Example
------------ | ----------- | -------
`boxfuse:env` | The Boxfuse [environment](/docs/environments) | prod
`boxfuse:app` | The Boxfuse application | myuser/myapp
`boxfuse:image` | The Boxfuse image | myuser/myapp:1.2.3
`Name` | (For EC2 instances only) The Boxfuse image and environment | boxfuse myuser/myapp:1.2.3@prod

## Introducing Dead-Easy Custom Tags

In addition to the standard tags automatically created by Boxfuse you can now also specify one or more **custom tags**
that should be applied to all created AWS resources that Boxfuse creates.

### Typical Uses 

Being able to add custom tags is particularly useful in a number of scenarios:
 
- Cost allocation in your monthly AWS bill
- Creating Resource Groups in the AWS Console
- Automatic use of spot instances with [AutoSpotting](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting)

And much more!

### How it works

For each app in each environment you can now define a set of custom tags that should be added in addition to the
existing Boxfuse ones. To achieve this you can either use the Boxfuse Console:

![AWS Console](/assets/posts/tags/tags.png){: .screenshot}

Or if you prefer you can also simply use the Boxfuse client:

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse cfg myapp -env=prod <strong>-tags.</strong>team=frontend-dev <strong>-tags.</strong>spot-enabled=true</pre>

And that's it! All new AWS resources Boxfuse now provisions in the `prod` environment for `myapp` will now receive these
two custom tags in additional to the standard Boxfuse ones.
