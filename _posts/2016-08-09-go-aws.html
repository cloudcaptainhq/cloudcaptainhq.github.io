<p>Go is a highly productive language with a broad ecosystem for developing modern applications and
    microservices. It has the unique advantage of combining a great standard library with garbage collection
    and fast compilation down to a single native binary.
</p>

<p>Today we're going to look at <strong>deploying Go applications effortlessly to AWS</strong>
    using <strong><a href="/blog/welcome">Boxfuse</a></strong>.</p>

<p><a href="/">Boxfuse</a> is based upon 3 core principles:</p>
<table class="table">
    <tr>

        <td><a href="/learn/why"><strong>

        </strong></a></td>
        <td>Creating servers and never modifying them again by treating a server as one immutable
            unit that is regenerated after every change and promoted unchanged from environment to environment.
            This eliminates drift and increases reliability by ensuring you run the exact same code in production as
            the code you tested in test.

<h2>The plan</h2>
<p>To see this in action, our plan is to first <strong>create a new Go web app</strong> which we'll <strong>fuse into a minimal Boxfuse
    image</strong> that can be deployed unchanged both on VirtualBox and AWS.</p>

<p>We'll then <strong>deploy our image to VirtualBox</strong> (great for rapid feedback and quick local tests),
    push it to the Boxfuse Vault (our secure online repository) and <strong>run it on AWS</strong>.</p>

<p>And finally we'll <strong>update it on AWS with zero-downtime</strong> blue/green deployments.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before we begin, ensure you have successfully:</p>
<ol>
    <li>created a <strong><a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse Account</a></strong> (simply log in with your
        GitHub account, it's free)
    </li>
    <li>downloaded and installed the latest <strong><a href="/getstarted/download">Boxfuse Client</a></strong></li>
    <li>downloaded and installed the latest version of <strong><a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Go</a></strong></li>
    <li>downloaded and installed the latest version of <strong><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></strong>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating the Go application</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to create and deploy a simple Go application.</p>

<p>Start by creating a directory for our app:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> mkdir getstarted-go</pre>

<p>And navigate to it:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> cd getstarted-go</pre>

<p>Now create a file called <code>main.go</code> with the following contents:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, I love Boxfuse!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}</pre>

<p>Now let's make sure we are compiling for Linux x64. If you are on Linux already, you can safely skip this step.</p>

<p>Windows users should invoke:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> set GOOS=linux</pre>

<p>And Mac OSX users should invoke:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> export GOOS=linux</pre>

<p>Now go ahead and compile the app into a single executable:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> go build -ldflags="-s"</pre>

<h2>Fusing a Boxfuse image and running it locally on VirtualBox</h2>

<p>Now it's time to fuse your application into a Boxfuse image and launch an instance of it on VirtualBox:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> boxfuse run -ports.http=8080 -image=getstarted-go:1.0

Creating getstarted-go ...
Mapping getstartedgo-dev-myuser.boxfuse.io to 127.0.0.1 ...
Created App getstarted-go (single-instance / none)
Fusing Image for getstarted-go (ELF64) ...
Image fused in 00:00.517s (7170 K) -> myuser/getstarted-go:1.0
Launching Instance of myuser/getstarted-go:1.0 on VirtualBox ...
Forwarding http port localhost:8080 -> vb-f6dba4e5:8080
Instance launched in 00:03.055s -> vb-f6dba4e5
Waiting for Payload to start on vb-f6dba4e5:8080 (expecting HTTP 200 at / within 300s) ...
Payload started in 00:00.009s -> http://127.0.0.1:8080</pre>

<p>In just a few seconds Boxfuse found your application, detected its type,
    generated an image for it and launched an instance of that image on VirtualBox.</p>

<p>Now open your browser and navigate to this address to see your new application up and running within the VirtualBox
    VM:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/getstarted/go-virtualbox.png">

<p>You can also see your newly created image:</p>

<pre class="console" style="font-size: 90%"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> boxfuse ls

Images available locally:
+--------------------------+---------------+-------+---------+--------------+--------+---------------------+
| Image                    |    Payload    | Debug | Runtime |    Ports     |  Size  |    Generated at     |
+--------------------------+---------------+-------+---------+--------------+--------+---------------------+
| myuser/getstarted-go:1.0 | getstarted-go | false | ELF64   | http -> 8080 | 7170 K | 2016-08-08 19:38:56 |
+--------------------------+---------------+-------+---------+--------------+--------+---------------------+
Total: 1</pre>

<p>As well as the instance that is running:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> boxfuse ps

Running Instances on VirtualBox in the dev environment :
+-------------+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
|  Instance   |          Image           |        Type         |          URL          |     Launched at     |
+-------------+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| vb-f6dba4e5 | myuser/getstarted-go:1.0 | 4 CPU / 1024 MB RAM | http://127.0.0.1:8080 | 2016-08-08 19:38:59 |
+-------------+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
Total: 1</pre>

<h2>Deploying your application to AWS</h2>

<p>Now let's deploy the image to AWS. As Boxfuse works with your AWS account, it first needs the necessary permissions
    to do so.
    So if you haven't already done it, go to the Boxfuse Console and <strong><a
            href="https://console.boxfuse.com/#/awsAccount">connect your AWS account</a></strong> now.</p>

<p>Every new Boxfuse account comes with 3 environments: <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code>.
    <code>dev</code> is your local VirtualBox environment and <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code> are on AWS.</p>

<p>So let's deploy our application to the <code>prod</code> environment on AWS:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> boxfuse run getstarted-go:1.0 -env=prod

Pushing myuser/getstarted-go:1.0 ...
Verifying myuser/getstarted-go:1.0 ...
Waiting for AWS to create an AMI for myuser/getstarted-go:1.0 in eu-central-1 (this may take up to 50 seconds) ...

Creating Cloud Watch Alarm for Instance auto-recovery -> i-921e9a2f-auto-recovery-alarm
Waiting for AWS to boot Instance i-921e9a2f and Payload to start at http://54.93.51.85:8080/ ...

Remapping Elastic IP 52.28.244.5 to i-921e9a2f ...
Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...
Deployment completed successfully. myuser/getstarted-go:1.0 is up and running at http://getstartedgo-myuser.boxfuse.io:8080/</pre>

<p>Notice that we have now specified an image, as we want to reuse our image unchanged instead fusing a new one.</p>

<p>With that one command Boxfuse has automatically pushed your image to the Boxfuse Vault as well as provisioned,
    configured and secured all necessary AWS resources. There is no manual work necessary on your behalf.</p>

<p>All you need to do is simply navigate to your new domain to see your Go application in action on AWS:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/getstarted/go-aws.png">

<h2>Bonus: update your application using blue/green deployments</h2>

<p>Now let's take things one step further and deploy an update of your application with <strong>zero downtime</strong>.
</p>

<p>Start by modifying <code>main.go</code> with a simple change:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">...
<del>fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, I love Boxfuse!")</del>
<strong>fmt.Fprintf(w, "Updated by Boxfuse with zero downtime!")</strong>
...</pre>

<p>Then rebuild the tgz:</p>
<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> go build -ldflags="-s"</pre>

<p>Finally, deploy the new version of your application to AWS:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-go&gt;</span> boxfuse run -ports.http=8080 -env=prod -image=getstarted-go:2.0

Fusing Image for getstarted-go (ELF64) ...

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, we saw how to <strong>deploy and update a Go application to AWS</strong> using
    <strong>Boxfuse</strong> in 3 easy steps.</p>

<p>First
    we fused our application into a <strong>7 MB Boxfuse image</strong> in <strong>under 1 second</strong> and ran an
    instance of it on VirtualBox. We then
    deployed the same image unchanged to AWS. And finally we updated our application on AWS with zero downtime using
    blue/green deployments.</p>

<p>To do so we used <strong><a href="/">Boxfuse</a></strong> and its 3 core principles:
    <a href="/learn/why"><strong>
        <nobr>Immutable Infrastructure</nobr>
    </strong></a>,
    <a href="/learn/how"><strong>Minimal Images</strong></a> and
    <strong>Blue/Green deployments</strong>.
