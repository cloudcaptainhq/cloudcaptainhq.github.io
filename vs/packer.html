    <h1>Packer vs Boxfuse</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Boxfuse is a simple, fast and robust alternative to Packer for creating AWS AMIs for JVM and Node.js apps.<br/>Here's why you should consider switching...</p>

        <div class="col-md-10">
            <p>Thinking of making the switch to Boxfuse to produce AWS AMIs for your JVM and Node.js apps?</p>
            <p>We want to make the decision as easy as possible, so we’ve put together some info that'll help you decide which option is best for you.</p>
            <p>Below, you'll find information to help you compare Boxfuse and Packer, including features, pricing and thoughts from current Boxfuse customers who have made the switch.</p>

            <h2>1. Boxfuse is easier and more robust than Packer</h2>
            <p>Boxfuse is all about making you productive so you can focus on delighting your customers instead
                dealing with infrastructure issues. We made sure Boxfuse is a joy to use by making building AWS AMIs for
                JVM application absolutely trivial. There are no lengthy complicated
            descriptors and no tedious OS provisioning. Instead all you need is a single command, <strong>boxfuse convert</strong>,
                which will take you all the way from JVM application to fully-baked AMI with no configuration required:</p>

            <pre class="console">&gt; <strong>boxfuse convert</strong> myapp-1.0.jar

Fusing Image for myapp-1.0.jar ...
Image fused in 00:06.525s (55362 K) -> myuser/myapp:1.0
Pushing myuser/myapp:1.0 ...
Verifying myuser/myapp:1.0 ...
Waiting for AWS to create an AMI for myuser/myapp:1.0 in eu-central-1 (this may take up to 50 seconds) ...
AMI created in 00:19.777s -> ami-e66264fb</pre>

            <p>Boxfuse does this by first analysing your application and then using that information to automatically
                generate an image with a minimal Linux-based OS on-the-fly. Boxfuse then uploads your new image to AWS and converts it to an AMI in the region of your choice.</p>

            <p>Boxfuse runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and comes with special optimizations for popular tools and frameworks
                like Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Grails, Play, Executable Jars, Tomcat and TomEE.</p>

            <h2>2. Boxfuse is faster and images are smaller</h2>
            <p>At Boxfuse we strongly believe that being able to iterate quickly is a must. And that's why we've built
            the industry's fastest AMI creation process. You can literally go from a jar or war file on your local
            machine to a fully baked AMI in well under 60 seconds and sometimes even under 30 if AWS isn't under too much load.</p>

            <img src="/assets/posts/amis-in-30-seconds/boxfuse-vs-packer.png">

            <p>Part of the reason why we manage to do that is size of our images. The minimal OS we generate is less than
            1% of the size of a general purpose OS like Ubuntu. This results in much smaller AMI sizes which directly
            translates to faster instance boot times.</p>

            <img src="/assets/posts/amis-in-30-seconds/boxfuse-vs-packer-size.png">

            <p>In fact this graph doesn't even do it justice as Boxfuse images are usually measured in the tens of MBs,
            but AWS shows them as 1 GB as this is their smallest supported EBS volume size.</p>

                    process, but also made it 2x faster. The Boxfuse Maven plugin made the

            <h2>3. Boxfuse is built for Continuous Deployment</h2>
            <p>Continuous Deployment is critically important for many companies today, allowing them to innovate and iterate faster.</p>

            <p>Boxfuse fully embraces this by treating build tool plugins as first-class citizens, making it effortless
                to integrate AMI building into your pipeline. In addition to its command-line client,
                Boxfuse comes with both Maven and Gradle plugins which can be readily integrated through the usual means:</p>

            <p>Gradle: <code>build.gradle</code></p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">plugins {
    id "com.boxfuse.client" version "{{site.boxfuseVersion}}"
}</pre>

            <p>Maven: <code>pom.xml</code></p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.boxfuse.client&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;boxfuse-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;{{site.boxfuseVersion}}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</pre>

            <p>For rapid turnarounds and fast feedback, Boxfuse also lets you run your images on VirtualBox. This is a
            great way to run your integration tests locally before creating an AMI. And unlike Packer, Boxfuse's image
            are only created once and can be run unchanged on both VirtualBox and AWS, giving you perfect environment parity.</p>


            <h2>4. Boxfuse is affordable</h2>
            <p>We get it, Packer is free.</p>
            <p>And free is a great price, especially for small businesses.</p>
            <p>But we believe that the value you’ll get from Boxfuse <em>far</em> outweighs the cost. And our customers agree.</p>
            <p>If our zero configuration AMI building features can save your team just <em>30 minutes per month</em>,
                then Boxfuse will more than pay for itself.</p>
            <p>Our pricing is simple: your first application is on us and after that plans start at just $25 per month.</p>
