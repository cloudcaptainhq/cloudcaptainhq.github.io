<p>When Boxfuse deploys your app it will automatically create a <code>boxfuse.io</code> subdomain like
    <code>myapp-myuser.boxfuse.io</code> for you to easily access it.</p>

<p>If your application is externally visible you may want to use your own domain though, like <code>myapp.mygreatcompany.com</code>.
</p>

<h2>Using Route 53</h2>
<p>If you use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">AWS Route 53</a> to manage your domain, you can simply
    configure the domain for your app by configuring it in the Boxfuse Console:</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/img/custom-domain.png"></p>

<p>In this example where you own the domain <code>mygreatcompany.com</code> and it is managed by AWS Route 53,
    your application will now be available under <code>myapp.mygreatcompany.com</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can of course also configure this with the Boxfuse Client using the <a
        href="/docs/commandline/cfg#domain">-domain=... parameter</a>.</p>

<h2>Using another DNS provider</h2>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you wish to make use of <a href="/docs/tls">automatic TLS (SSL) certificates</a> you must use Route 53 for your DNS.</p>

<p>If you host your DNS records outside of Route 53, you must create a new <strong>CNAME record</strong> which point to
    the domain generated by Boxfuse.</p>
<p>In the example above, the new CNAME record for the <code>myapp.com.</code> domain would be called <code>www</code>
    and would point to <code>myapp-myuser.boxfuse.io</code>. Your application will then be available under <code>www.myapp.com</code>.
