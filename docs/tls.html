<p>Boxfuse makes it dead-easy to run your app via HTTPS using TLS (SSL) certificates.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>First ensure that you have <a href="/docs/commandline/create">created your app</a> as <code>load-balanced</code> with <code>tls.type</code> set to <code>acm</code>.
    This will ensure your app will have its TLS (SSL) certificates automatically managed by the AWS Certificate Manager.</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/img/create-acm.png"></p>

<p>To get started you will need two things: a <a href="/docs/domains">custom domain</a> and a certificate.</p>

<h2>Obtaining your certificate</h2>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=eu-central-1#/">AWS Certificate Manager</a> page
    of the AWS Console and request a certificate for your domain:</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/img/acm-request.png"></p>

<p>If you plan to deploy apps to multiple subdomains to accommodate several microservices or simply different
    <a href="/docs/environments">environments</a> we highly recommend simply getting a <strong>wildcard certificate</strong>
    instead of one for each domain individually. This can be achieved by prefixing your domain with <code>*.</code>.
    In the example above where let's say you own the domain <code>mygreatcompany.com</code>, requesting a certificate
    for <code>*.mygreatcompany.com</code> will then allow you to secure all subdomains like
    <code>myapp.mygreatcompany.com</code> or <code>other-service.mygreatcompany.com</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have received the email from AWS requesting you to confirm your ownership of the domain for the certificate,
    click on the approval link:</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/img/acm-email.png"></p>

<p>And your certificate will be ready to use.</p>

<h2>Configure your environment to use a custom domain</h2>

<p>Before running your application, configure your environment to use your <a href="/docs/domains">custom domain</a>
    for which you just obtained a TLS (SSL) certificate.</p>

<h2>Run your application</h2>
<p>You can now run your application as you normally would and Boxfuse will <strong>automatically provision and configure your load
    balancer</strong> to listen to your <a href="/docs/domains">custom domain</a> with the <strong>correct certificate</strong>.
    Your app will then automatically be exposed via HTTPS with a green lock in the browser once deployed.</p>

<p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/img/https-green-lock.png"></p>

<p>Make sure to check our documentation for your specific application type to see if any additional adjustments are
    necessary for your specific configuration.</p>

<h2>Certificate renewal</h2>

<p>Once in place your <strong>TLS (SSL) certificates will be automatically renewed</strong> and updated before they expire without any
action required on your part.</p>
