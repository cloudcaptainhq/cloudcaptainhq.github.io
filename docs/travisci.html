    <p><strong><a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a></strong> is a great service for building projects hosted on GitHub. In
    addition to providing very easy Continuous Integration, Travis CI also <strong><a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/boxfuse/">integrates seamlessly with CloudCaptain</a></strong> to
    easily become a fantastic <strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> platform.</p>

    <h2>Using the CloudCaptain Command-line client</h2>
    <p>Travis CI's deployment tool comes with <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/boxfuse/">native support for the CloudCaptain Command-line client</a>.</p>
    <p>All you need to do to get started is defined two <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables">encrypted Travis CI environment variables</a>
        for your repository (securely stored and not visible in your build logs):</p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th><code>BOXFUSE_USER</code></th>
            <td>Your CloudCaptain User</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><code>BOXFUSE_SECRET</code></th>
            <td>Your CloudCaptain Secret</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Then add the following to your <code>.travis.yml</code> file:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">deploy:
  provider: boxfuse
  payload: target/myapp-1.0.jar</pre>

    <p>And that's it! The CloudCaptain command-line client will be automatically installed and configured to deploy on
    every successful build. More info on the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/boxfuse/">CloudCaptain page in the Travis CI docs</a>.</p>

    <h2>Using the CloudCaptain Maven Plugin</h2>

    <p>Alternatively to the method described above, you can also simply use the <a href="/docs/maven">CloudCaptain Maven plugin</a>
    directly from your <code>pom.xml</code> to deploy your application.</p>

    <p>Just as for the command-line tool, you will need to define two <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables">encrypted Travis CI environment variables</a>
        for your repository (securely stored and not visible in your build logs):</p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th><code>BOXFUSE_USER</code></th>
            <td>Your CloudCaptain User</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><code>BOXFUSE_SECRET</code></th>
            <td>Your CloudCaptain Secret</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>By default, Travis CI worker nodes are configured with <strong>too little heap</strong> for the JVM to work well with Maven and CloudCaptain together.</p>
    <p>Add the following to your <code>.travis.yml</code> to fix this:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">before_install: echo "MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx2048m" > ~/.mavenrc</pre>
