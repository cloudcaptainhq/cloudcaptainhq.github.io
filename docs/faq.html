    <h2 id="question">Where can I ask a question?</h2>

    <p>We are actively monitoring the <a class="stackoverflow-tag" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse">boxfuse</a> tag
        on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse"><strong>StackOverflow</strong></a>. Ask
    your question there and either we or someone from the community will answer it.</p>

    <h2 id="issue">Where can I report an issue?</h2>

    <p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/boxfuse/boxfuse-issues/issues"><strong>public issue tracker</strong></a> on GitHub, where you can easily report any issues you may find.</p>

    <h2 id="database">How can I use a database?</h2>

    <p>You can use any external database. For optimal integration, we recommend using our automatically provisioned
        <a href="/docs/databases">Amazon RDS PostgreSQL</a> instances for your relational database needs.</p>

    <h2 id="logs">How can I use access my logs?</h2>

    <p>You can access your logs using the <a href="/docs/commands/logs">boxfuse logs command</a>. We strongly recommend
        configuring your application for <a href="/blog/cloudwatch-logs">AWS CloudWatch Logs</a> as this gives you many
        essential features like log aggregation, live tailing, filtering and more. Also if you are on the JVM, make sure
        to integrate our <a href="/blog/logback-log4j2-appender">Logback or Log4J2 appender</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="ssh">How can I SSH into my instance?</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse instances come with <a href="/blog/no-ssh">no SSH on board</a> by design. Instead we provide alternative
        more scalable and secure ways to accomplish common tasks such as <a href="/blog/cloudwatch-logs">accessing logs</a>,
        <a href="/blog/debug">remote debugging</a>, or <a href="/blog/newrelic">monitoring</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="db">How can manually connect to my database?</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse offers you two different ways to accomplish this as documented on our <a href="/docs/databases#connections">database page</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="timeout">My instance runs into a health check timeout. What could be the issue?</h2>

    <p>A health check timeout typically occurs for one of two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your application startup is effectively slower as the health check timeout</li>
        <li>The health check and the application configuration don't match</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first problem can be solved by either moving to a larger and faster instance, increasing
        <code>healthcheck.timeout</code> or optimizing the application startup.</p>

    <p>The second problem can be due to either the <code>healthcheck.path</code> being incorrect,
        <code>healthcheck.port</code> being incorrect or the ports configuration simply not matching the ports
        opened up by the application. Example: the http port is configured to be 80, yet the application listens on 8080.
        The solution for all of these is the same, carefully review your configuration and check the <a href="/docs/commands#logs">logs</a>
        to make sure everything matches.
    </p>

    <h2 id="jdbc">My application includes the MySQL or PostgreSQL JDBC driver, but Boxfuse doesn't provision any databases. What could be the issue?</h2>

    <p>When you first fuse an image for a Boxfuse application that hasn't been explicitly created in the Boxfuse Console, Boxfuse will
    automatically create that application for you. To do so, Boxfuse detects the any compatible JDBC drivers you have included and
        configures the application to use the correct type of database</p>

    <p>Once the application has been created, the type of database it uses cannot be changed anymore.</p>

    <p>This means that if you initially created the application without a database, or fused an image when it did not contain a JDBC driver,
    even adding a JDBC driver later will not trigger Boxfuse's autodetection anymore.</p>

    <p>To use Boxfuse's <a href="/docs/databases">database auto-provisioning</a> anyway, simply delete your application in the Boxfuse Console
    and recreate it with the correct database type or fuse a new image based on a payload that contains a compatible JDBC driver.</p>
