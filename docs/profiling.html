    <p>Do you suspect a memory leak, a thread deadlock or unusually high CPU usage? Boxfuse makes it trivial to profile your apps.</p>

    <h2>Enabling JMX remote management</h2>

    <p>To enable remote management of your JVM via JMX simply fuse or run your image with <code>-jvm.jmx</code>. This
        will open an additional port to which your JMX client (like Java VisualVM or Java Mission Control) can connect. By default
        this <a href="/blog/restricted-ports">port is restricted</a> to only allow connections from the IP address of
    your local machine and you will need the following credentials to log in:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>User:</strong> boxfuse</li>
        <li><strong>Password:</strong> boxfuse</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you launch an instance of an image set up for JMX remote management you should see a message like this:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run myapp.jar -jvm.jmx

...

Ready to accept JMX connections -> 127.0.0.1:1099 (user: boxfuse / password: boxfuse)</pre>

    <h2>Configuring the JMX port</h2>

    <p>You can configure both the port number as well as the restrictions by manually specifying <code>-ports.jmx=...</code>
        when fusing or running your image. You can use any of the <a href="/docs/commandline/fuse#ports">usual formats</a> for
        defining the port. Just remember that the protocol must be <code>tcp</code> and that you of course should be able to access it.</p>

    <h2 id="visualvm">Profiling with Java VisualVM</h2>

    <p>Start by launching Java VisualVM:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> jvisualvm</pre>

    <p>You can then simply connect Java VisualVM to that address using those credentials by adding a JMX connection:</p>

    <p>And you can now profile CPU, memory and threads as you normally would:</p>

    <h2 id="jmc">Profiling and Managing with Java Mission Control</h2>

    <p>Start by launching Java Mission Control:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> jmc</pre>

    <p>You can then simply connect Java Mission Control to that address using those credentials by creating a JVM connection:</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/jmc-setup.png" class="screenshot">

    <p>Finally select <strong>MBean Server</strong> and profile CPU, memory and threads as well as inspect and invoke actions on MBeans as you normally would:</p>
