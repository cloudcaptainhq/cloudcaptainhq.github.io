<p><strong><a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a></strong> is a great service for in-depth monitoring of your
    instances, both at the operating system and application level.</p>

<h2>Application Monitoring</h2>

<p>To provide you deep insights into your app, New Relic comes with monitoring at the application level with detailed analysis
    of transactions, throughput, database queries and much more.</p>

<h3>Installation (JVM apps only)</h3>

<p>For JVM apps, when supplying your New Relic license key as described above, Boxfuse will also automatically
install and configure the <strong>New Relic Java agent</strong>.</p>

<p>The application will then begin reporting to New Relic as <code>myapp (myenv)</code>.
    In case of an application named <code>hello</code> deployed in the <code>prod</code> <a href="/docs/environments">environment</a>
    this would then be <code>hello (prod)</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can also supply a <code>newrelic.yml</code> configuration file for the Java agent and Boxfuse will
automatically use that instead. Boxfuse will then install the agent for you, but won't override any application name you may have configured.
    If you haven't configured a New Relic license key as described above, Boxfuse will use
the license key contained in your <code>newrelic.yml</code> configuration file instead.</p>

<h3>Java Agent version</h3>
<p>By default Boxfuse installs the latest version of the New Relic Java agent. If you want to switch an
    older version, you can do so using the <code>-components.newrelic-java</code> configuration setting:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run my-app-1.0.jar <strong>-components.newrelic-java=</strong>3.32.0</pre>

<p>To find out which New Relic Java agent versions are available from the Boxfuse Inventory you can simply issue:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse inventory newrelic-java</pre>
