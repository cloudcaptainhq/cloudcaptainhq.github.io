    <p>Boxfuse instances are strictly ephemeral. Not only are they completely destroyed once the are terminated, but
    their file system also lives exclusively in RAM.</p>

    <h2>Persistent files</h2>

    <p>Apps that need to store files durably and persistently should do so off-instance.</p>

    <h3 id="s3">S3</h3>
    <p>We recommend using an
        <strong>S3 bucket</strong> for this. Not only is it cost effective, but you can also serve large files directly
    to clients either via unsecured buckets or pre-signed URLs.</p>

    <h3 id="efs">EFS</h3>
    <p>Alternatively you can also consider mounting an <strong>Elastic File System</strong>. This comes with trade-offs though. The
    clear advantage is that from an application's perspective this is just a regular NFS directory. However not only
    is this service not currently available in all all AWS regions, but you also lose the advantage of being able to
        offload large file up- and downloads as you can with S3.</p>

    <p>You can mount an elastic file system, by adding these statements to the start of your main method:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">new File("/efs").mkdir();
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 <em>&lt;your-efs-id&gt;</em>.efs.<em>&lt;your-aws-region&gt;</em>.amazonaws.com:/ /efs").waitFor();</pre>

    <p>The elastic file system is now mounted at <code>/efs</code> and is ready for you to use.</p>

    <h2 id="tmp">Temporary files</h2>

    <p>If your application needs to temporarily store files it can afford to lose should the instance die, then the
        <strong><code>/tmp</code> directory</strong> in your instance is the perfect place for this. It is a separate <strong>fully encrypted filesystem</strong> that
        resides on disk (unlike the other directories in your Boxfuse instance which reside in RAM).</p>

    <p>With the <code>-tmp=...</code> parameter Boxfuse can automatically provision between 0 and 16384 GB of space, with 1 GB being the default.</p>

    <p>Every application (and its JVM) are automatically configured by Boxfuse to use the <code>/tmp</code> directory for
    creating temporary files. There is no manual configuration necessary on your part.</p>
