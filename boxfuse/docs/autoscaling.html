    <p>Boxfuse can automatically
        configure AWS to <strong>auto-scale your application</strong> based on any of the following metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>average CPU usage</li>
        <li>incoming network traffic</li>
        <li>outgoing network traffic</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Boxfuse will then configure AWS CloudWatch to monitor and act upon these metrics for your application.</p>

    <p>Whenever the current load of your system exceeds the thresholds defined, the AWS auto-scaling group will then automatically add or remove
        capacity so that you <strong>never have to worry again about paying for more than you actually need</strong>.
    All that while having the peace of mind your system will always have enough capacity to serve your users, regardless
    of traffic spikes.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is only available for load-balanced applications.</p>

    <h2>Using the Boxfuse Console</h2>

    <p>You can easily set up your application to auto-scale on AWS within a specific <a href="/docs/environments">environment</a>:</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/auto-scaling-console.png" alt="Auto-Scaling" class="screenshot">
    <p>All you need to do is drag a slider to indicate the minimum and the maximum number of instances you want, and
        specify at which CPU usage thresholds the scaling activities should happen, and click Scale. Boxfuse and AWS will take care of the rest.</p>
    <p>Just as for the command-line tool, Boxfuse will automatically configure AWS CloudWatch to monitor the CPU usage of your instances. If the rolling
        average over a period of 300 seconds exceeds 75%, Auto-Scaling will kick in and additional EC2 instances will be provisioned up to a maximum of 10. If CPU usage
        instead drops to 25% or below, EC2 instances will be terminated down to a minimum of 2.</p>

    <h2>Using the Boxfuse Command-line client</h2>

    <p>Alternatively to the method described above, you can also simply use the <a href="/docs/commandline">Boxfuse Command-line Client</a>
        to configure this:</p>
   <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse scale myapp -env=prod -capacity=2-10:t2.micro:cpu25-75:300

Successfully configured myapp to auto-scale between 2 and 10 t2.micro instances based on average CPU load over 300 seconds, scaling in at 25% and below, scaling out at 75% and above.</pre>

    <p>And that's all! Boxfuse will automatically configure AWS CloudWatch to monitor the CPU usage of your instances. If the rolling
        average over a period of 300 seconds exceeds 75%, Auto-Scaling will kick in and additional EC2 instances will be provisioned up to a maximum of 10. If CPU usage
        instead drops to 25% or below, EC2 instances will be terminated down to a minimum of 2.</p>

    <p>For more details and full syntax details for all available options, read the <a href="/docs/commandline/scale#capacity">documentation for the scale command</a>.</p>
