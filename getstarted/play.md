This tutorial will get you started with Boxfuse and Play. Together we'll create a new Play app, deploy it to AWS and
update it with zero downtime. Altogether this should take you about **5-10 minutes** to complete.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have successfully:

1. created a <strong><a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse Account</a></strong> (simply log in with your GitHub account, it's free)
2. downloaded and installed the latest <strong><a href="/getstarted/download">Boxfuse Client</a></strong>
3. downloaded and installed the latest <strong><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK</a></strong> with `JAVA_HOME` set up correctly
4. downloaded and installed the latest version of <strong><a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">SBT</a></strong>
5. downloaded and installed the latest version of <strong><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></strong>

## Creating the Play application

Start by creating a Play Scala application using SBT:

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8</pre>

Set the name to `getstarted-play` and keep the default for all other settings.
 
Once the generator completes, navigate to the newly created directory:

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> cd getstarted-play</pre>

Then set the version in `build.sbt` to 1.0:

<pre class="prettyprint">version := "1.0"</pre>

Finally build a distribution zip:

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-play&gt;</span> sbt dist</pre>

Great. Your Play application distribution zip is now available under `target/universal/getstarted-play-1.0.zip`.

## Fusing a Boxfuse image and running it locally on VirtualBox

Now it's time to fuse your application into a Boxfuse image and launch an instance of it on VirtualBox:

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-play&gt;</span> boxfuse run</pre>

This command will run for a few seconds. During this time, Boxfuse will find your application, detect its type,
generating an image for it and launch it on VirtualBox. When it completes you should see a message like this:

<pre class="console"><strong class="success">Successfully started payload in 00:09.407s -> http://127.0.0.1:9000</strong></pre>

Now open your browser and navigate to this address to see your new application up and running within the VirtualBox VM:

![Play on VirtualBox](/assets/img/getstarted/play-virtualbox.png){: .screenshot}

You can also see your newly created image:

<pre class="console" style="font-size: 89%"><span>getstarted-play&gt;</span> boxfuse ls

## Deploying your application to AWS

Now let's deploy the image to AWS. As Boxfuse works with your AWS account, it first needs the necessary permissions to do so.
So if you haven't already done so, go to the Boxfuse Console and **[connect your AWS account](https://console.boxfuse.com/#/awsAccount)** now.

Every new Boxfuse account comes with 3 environments: `dev`, `test` and `prod`.
`dev` is your local VirtualBox environment and `test` and `prod` are on AWS.

So let's deploy our application to the `prod` environment on AWS:

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-play&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod

Pushing myuser/getstarted-play:1.0 ...
Verifying myuser/getstarted-play:1.0 ...

Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...
<strong class="success">Successfully running myuser/getstarted-play:1.0 in prod at http://getstartedplay-myuser.boxfuse.io:9000/</strong></pre>

Notice that we have now specified an image, as we want to reuse our image unchanged instead fusing a new one.

With that one command Boxfuse has automatically pushed your image to the Boxfuse Vault as well as provisioned,
configured and secured all necessary AWS resources. There is no manual work necessary on your behalf.

All you need to do is simply navigate to your new domain to see your Play application in action on AWS:

![Play on AWS](/assets/img/getstarted/play-aws.png){: .screenshot}

## Bonus: update your application using blue/green deployments

Now let's take things one step further and deploy an update of your application with **zero downtime**.

Start by modifying `app/views/index.scala.html` with a simple change:

```
@()
                         
@main("Updated by Boxfuse with zero downtime") {
  <h1>Updated by Boxfuse with zero downtime!</h1>
}
```

then bump the version in `build.sbt`:

<pre class="prettyprint">version := "1.1"</pre>

and rebuild the dist:

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-play&gt;</span> sbt clean dist</pre>

Finally, deploy the new version of your application to AWS:

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-play&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod
